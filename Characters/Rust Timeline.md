# Rust's Timeline

## Birth to Age 2: Unknown Origins

### Approximate Year: Unknown
**Location:** Goblin encampment, [[Locations/Isger|Isger]]

Very little is known about Rust's earliest years:
- Born in a goblin tribe somewhere in western Isger
- Parents and tribe identity unknown
- Community likely destroyed during or after the Goblinblood Wars
- Found as a toddler (approximately age 2) in burned wreckage
- Only survivor discovered by Chelaxian authorities

**What Rust Knows:**
- Nothing. His first clear memories begin at the monastery around age 4-5
- Doesn't know his birth name, parents, or tribe
- The name "Rust" was given to him by the Sisters

**Historical Context:**
- Post-Goblinblood Wars cleanup operations
- Systematic elimination of goblinoid populations in Isger
- Most goblin children were killed rather than captured
- His survival to reach the monastery was exceptional

## Age 2-12: The Monastery Years

### Age 2: Arrival at the Monastery
**Location:** [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|Monastery of the Golden Erinyes]]

- Brought to the monastery as one of the few goblin children "spared"
- Named "Rust" by [[NPCs/Sister Malhana|Sister Malhana]] for his coloring and perceived worthlessness
- Placed in the orphan dormitory
- Too young to understand what had happened or where he was
- Earliest fragmented memories begin here

### Age 2-5: Early Conditioning
**The Dormitory:**
- Slept in the coldest bed by the door (deliberately assigned)
- Learned to cry silently to avoid punishment
- Began understanding he was considered lesser than human children
- First experiences with hunger, cold, and isolation

**The Rules:**
- Absolute obedience required
- Silence during meals, prayers, work
- No questioning authority
- Beatings for infractions
- Learned to be hypervigilant for danger

**Early Lessons:**
- Basic Common language
- Asmodean prayers (recited but not understood)
- Simple work tasks (emptying chamber pots, fetching water)
- Understanding of hierarchy: Sisters, human children, then him

### Age 5: First Literacy
**Educational Milestone:**
- Sister Malhana tested children for literacy potential
- Rust read a passage flawlessly on first attempt
- She noted his intelligence in records
- Mixed blessing: gained education but drew attention
- Discovered love of books and reading

**Punishment Pattern Established:**
- [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] began taking "special interest"
- More frequent visits to discipline chamber
- Beatings became systematic rather than reactive
- Started learning to dissociate during pain

### Age 6-8: Velenne's Observation Phase
**The Testing Begins:**
- Sister Velenne noticed Rust healed slightly faster than normal
- Began documenting recovery times
- Gradually increased severity of beatings
- Testing limits systematically
- Rust didn't understand why he was targeted more than others

**Daily Routine Solidified:**
- 5:00 AM: Wake, dress, make bed
- 5:15-7:15 AM: Morning prayers (kneeling on stone)
- 7:15-7:30 AM: Minimal breakfast
- 7:30 AM-Noon: Work assignments (laundry, kitchen, garden)
- Noon-12:30 PM: Brief midday meal
- 12:30-3:00 PM: Education (reading, writing, arithmetic, theology)
- 3:00-6:00 PM: More work
- 6:00-7:30 PM: Evening prayers
- 7:30-8:00 PM: Dinner (often denied as punishment)
- 8:00-9:00 PM: Scripture copying, meditation
- 9:00 PM: Locked in dormitory

**Skills Developed:**
- Reading (Common, began learning Goblin)
- Writing (neat, precise penmanship under threat of beating)
- Basic arithmetic
- Chelaxian history (heavily propagandized)
- Asmodean theology (which he internally rejected)
- Pattern recognition (survival skill)
- Emotional suppression

### Age 7: Infernal Lessons
**Language Education:**
- Began learning Infernal (language of devils and Asmodean law)
- Struggled initially with guttural sounds
- Sister Velenne's particular focus on pronunciation
- Beaten for mistakes until perfect
- Language he now speaks reluctantly

**Historical "Education":**
- Taught about Goblinblood Wars as "necessary genocide"
- Learned his people were considered "the enemy"
- Understood he existed by exception only
- Should have been killed with his tribe
- This knowledge profoundly shaped his worldview

### Age 8-9: Survival Strategies Refined
**Coping Mechanisms:**
- Perfected appearance of devotion during prayers
- Learned when to resist and when to yield
- Became expert at reading Sisters' moods
- Mapped monastery mentally (exits, guard patterns, locks)
- Planned impossible escapes to maintain hope

**Work Assignments:**
- Laundry detail (most common) - hands raw and bleeding
- Kitchen duty (rare privilege) - stealing scraps when possible
- Garden work (reward for good behavior) - where he found moments of peace
- Cleaning (Sisters' quarters, chapel, halls)

**The Garden:**
- Only place with sunlight and growing things
- Where he could see sky
- Brief respite from abuse
- Tried to behave well to earn garden assignments

### Age 10: Mika Arrives
**New Friendship:**
- [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]] arrived at age 8 (Rust was 10)
- Small human girl, brown hair, frightened
- Rust saw himself in her fear
- Warned her about rules secretly
- She thanked him - first genuine kindness he'd received

**Growing Bond:**
- Secret conversations in the garden
- Shared survival knowledge
- She called him "brave" (first time anyone said that)
- Sometimes shared his meager food portions
- Both punished when caught together
- She witnessed one of his beatings and cried out
- Both beaten severely after

**Deepening Abuse:**
- Sister Velenne intensified focus on Rust
- Public beatings to make examples
- Other children forced to watch
- Designed to break any sense of worth
- Rust's fast healing became more obvious

### Age 11: Escalation
**Theological Debate:**
- Sister teaching about divine hierarchy
- Rust asked thoughtful, challenging question
- Sister couldn't answer adequately
- Beaten for "undermining authority"
- Learned intelligence must be hidden or used carefully

**Public Example:**
- Velenne made one beating public
- All orphans forced to watch
- Demonstrated what happened to those who helped Rust
- Isolated him further from other children
- Designed to crush any remaining hope

**Increasing Desperation:**
- Punishments more frequent and severe
- Velenne's "experiments" with his healing
- Sometimes kept in discipline chamber for days
- Emerging pattern: he survived what should kill him
- But survival brought more attention, not relief

### Age 12: The Final Year
**Mika's Starvation:**
- Mika denied meals as punishment for multiple days
- Rust couldn't stand watching her starve
- Slipped her extra bread when he could
- Sister Velenne had been watching, waiting
- Perfect excuse for "final test"

**The Final Transgression:**
- Caught helping Mika with food
- Dragged to discipline chamber
- Velenne administered most severe beating yet
- Multiple broken bones, cracked ribs
- Internal bleeding, head trauma
- Injuries that should have been fatal

**The Night in the Chamber:**
- Left locked in discipline chamber overnight
- Expected to die or be broken permanently
- Alone on cold stone floor
- Twelve years old and dying

## Age 12: The Awakening

### The Manifestation
**Date:** One year before present (Rust was 12)  
**Location:** Discipline Chamber, [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|Monastery of the Golden Erinyes]]

**The Attention:**
- As Rust lay dying, something vast **noticed** him
- Not from within - the sensation came from elsewhere
- Something beyond normal reality turned its attention
- Decided this broken 12-year-old was worth preserving

**The Healing:**
- Power manifested violently over hours
- Bones ground back into place with audible cracks
- Skin sealed in unnatural patterns
- Internal damage repaired slowly, painfully
- Process took most of the night
- Pain increased rather than diminished
- Healing felt **alien**, not divine

**The Understanding:**
- This power wasn't his - something else sustained him
- The Sisters would never let him go if they found out
- He could survive things that should kill him
- But surviving didn't stop the pain
- This was his only chance to escape

### The Escape
**Dawn:**
- By morning, physically whole but traumatized
- Twelve years old making an impossible choice
- Stay: be studied, tortured, broken completely
- Run: probably die alone with no plan or resources

**The Flight:**
- When door unlocked for morning inspection, he ran
- Morning chaos covered his escape
- Guards not expecting "half-dead" child to run
- Small enough to hide where adults couldn't follow
- Newly manifested endurance kept him moving
- Pure terror and desperation overrode injury
- Made it outside monastery walls

**First Days Free:**
- No money, food, or supplies
- Hid during day, moved at night
- Terrified of pursuit
- Didn't know where to go
- Survived on scraps
- Curse kept him alive when exposure should have killed him
- Twelve years old and completely alone

## Age 12-13: The Wandering Year

### First Months (Age 12)
**Immediate Survival:**
- Stayed in wilderness initially (safer than towns)
- Learned to forage, find water, make shelter
- Discovered animals didn't fear or judge him
- First animal friendship with stray dog
- Started understanding his animal affinity

**Entering Civilization:**
- Eventually needed supplies only towns provided
- Learned to pass as traveling orphan
- Took odd jobs (stable work, farm labor)
- Kept moving to stay ahead of questions
- Always terrified of being recognized

**Early Challenges:**
- Still only 12, small even for a goblin
- Vulnerable to exploitation
- Had to hide fast healing
- Nightmares every night
- Constant fear of recapture

### Middle Months (Age 12, 6-8 Months After Escape)
**Growing Competence:**
- Better at survival and self-sufficiency
- Found work in stables (animals trusted him)
- Started offering minor healing services
- Learned to downplay abilities
- Moved north through Isger toward Druma

**The Sevenarches Incident:**
- Trying to evade someone curious about his survival
- Map showed Sevenarches as simple forest settlement
- At Thornwatch outpost, innkeeper warned him
- Rust ignored warning, confident in his curse
- Biggest mistake of his young life

**Into the Forest:**
- Birds stopped singing at tree line
- Unnatural stillness and wrongness
- Trees in perfect circles around carved stones
- Absolute silence fell
- Whispers in his skull, not his ears
- Something vast noticed the 12-year-old

**The Encounter:**
- Forest recognized his curse as kindred
- Showed him temporal layering, threshold doors
- Offered complete understanding of his power
- Price: his identity - wouldn't be Rust anymore
- Just something that used to be a goblin child
- Forest patient, waiting for his choice

**The Flight:**
- Pure childhood panic
- Ran until he collapsed
- Found himself at forest entrance (impossible)
- Staggered back to Thornwatch
- Took long detour around Sevenarches (weeks extra travel)
- Nightmares began that night

**What He Learned:**
- His curse is primordial, not divine
- Some knowledge costs too much
- Running isn't always cowardice
- Something powerful knows about him and waits
- He chose to stay himself over understanding

### Final Months (Age 12-13)
**Continued Wandering:**
- Through Druma and surrounding regions
- More stable work, better at fitting in
- Animals remained his most reliable companions
- Occasional healing work (carefully limited)
- Still moving, never settling

**Approaching Adulthood:**
- Turning 13 (goblin adulthood)
- Starting to feel less like running, more like searching
- Beginning to actively seek answers about his curse
- Dreams of Sevenarches less frequent but persistent
- Growing into his identity as survivor, not just victim

**Skills Developed:**
- Nature understanding (from animal work and observation)
- Medicine (practical healing experience)
- Survival skills (learned by necessity)
- Social skills (talking his way out of trouble)
- Stealth (essential for avoiding notice)

- Legal adult by goblin standards

**Physical Condition:**
- Healthy, no visible scars

**Psychological State:**
- Hypervigilant and cautious

### Current Motivations
**Immediate:**
- Survive day to day
- Find safe places to stay
- Earn enough for basic needs
- Avoid recognition or deep questioning
- Learn to control powers better

**Short-term:**
- Understand source of oracle abilities
- Find others who know about such powers
- Get better at healing without exposure
- Maybe find place to stay longer than days
- Continue searching for answers

**Long-term:**
- Understand curse without paying Sevenarches' price
- Create own meaning through action
- Perhaps help others escape similar situations
- Find somewhere he doesn't have to run from

**Rejected:**
- Worship of unknown power source
- Revenge against Sisters (too frightened)
- Understanding through Sevenarches (cost too high)
- Going back for Mika (too dangerous, he tells himself)

### Open Questions
- What exactly noticed him in the monastery?
- Why was he specifically preserved?
- What happened to Mika after he left?
- Do the Sisters search for him?
- Will he ever feel safe enough to stop running?
- What does Sevenarches want with him?
- Can he create genuine meaning for his life?

### Campaign Beginning
Rust stands at a threshold:
- No longer helpless child fleeing in terror
- Not yet confident hero with answers
- Young adult (by goblin standards) searching for purpose
- Carrying trauma but not broken by it
- Ready to begin truly searching rather than just surviving
- Perhaps ready to trust others, if slowly

The monastery shaped him. The awakening saved him. The wandering year taught him. Now, at thirteen, freshly adult and still searching, his true story begins.

*"Thirteen years alive. Ten years in hell. One year free. One lifetime of questions. But I'm still here. Still trying. Still learning who I want to be instead of what they told me I was. Maybe that's what it means to grow up."* - Rust's thoughts at the campaign start
