# Rust

## Overview
**Race:** Goblin  
**Class:** Life Oracle (Level 1)  
**Ancestry:** [[Game Mechanics/Unbreakable Ancestry|Unbreakable]]  
**Background:** [[Game Mechanics/Animal Whisperer Background|Animal Whisperer]]  
**Age:** 13 (goblin age of maturity - just reached adulthood)  
**Origin:** [[Locations/Isger|Isger]], found in the aftermath of the [[Events/Goblinblood Wars|Goblinblood Wars]]

## Physical Description
Rust stands at typical goblin height (just over 3 feet) with rust-colored skin that earned him his name. His rust-red eyes carry an intensity unusual for someone so young—the gaze of someone who has survived things that should have killed him. His body bears no scars despite the beatings and injuries he's endured; they heal without trace, leaving only the psychological marks behind.

He moves with practiced wariness, always aware of exits and potential threats. His clothing is practical and worn, chosen for function over form, typically in dark colors that help him blend. Despite his young age, he carries himself with the caution of someone much older.

## Personality
Rust is deeply distrustful of authority and organized religion, particularly anything connected to [[Deities/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]] or Hellknights. He speaks little about his past and deflects personal questions with practiced ease. Despite his traumatic upbringing, he possesses a stubborn compassion for the vulnerable and downtrodden—perhaps because he knows intimately what it means to be powerless.

He's pragmatic beyond his years, displaying cynicism that seems wrong on someone barely into adulthood. Yet he occasionally reveals flashes of unexpected kindness, especially toward animals and younger children. The contradiction seems to perplex even him. He has a particular soft spot for creatures that others deem worthless or disposable.

Rust rejects the notion that suffering has inherent meaning or purpose, viewing this as the poisonous doctrine of his abusers. Instead, he attempts to create his own meaning through action, even if he's not entirely sure what he's building toward. At 13, he's at the very beginning of this journey.

## Background: Animal Whisperer
During his year wandering after escaping the monastery, Rust discovered an unexpected affinity for animals. Perhaps it was his own experience as something "lesser" that let him connect with creatures others ignored or mistreated. He found that animals didn't care about his goblin heritage or his mysterious curse; they responded to kindness and patience.

He's worked briefly as a stable hand in a few towns, helped with herding work, and spent time observing wilderness animals. For someone so young, he's remarkably patient with creatures. Animals seem to sense something in him—perhaps the same otherworldly quality that makes his curse work. They trust him more readily than people do, and he returns that trust.

This connection to animals has proven practical: they alert him to danger, provide companionship without judgment, and occasionally lead him to people in need of healing. In many ways, animals were his first real teachers in what it meant to exist outside the Sisters' doctrine of suffering.

## The Curse/Gift of Life

### The Mystery
Rust is a Life Oracle, though he doesn't understand why or how. His power manifested violently during [[Events/Rust's Awakening|his final beating at the monastery]] about a year ago, triggered by trauma and proximity to death. The power doesn't feel like his own—it feels like attention from something vast and incomprehensible, something that noticed him in his moment of extremis and decided he was worth preserving.

The healing is regenerative but alien. Bones grind back into place with audible cracks. Skin seals over wounds in patterns that sometimes seem deliberate. The process isn't painless—it hurts differently than injury, a deep ache that resonates in places that shouldn't be able to ache.

At 13, having just reached goblin adulthood, Rust is only beginning to explore what his powers mean and where they come from.

### The Curse
As a Life Oracle, Rust bears the curse of his mystery. His body constantly tries to heal and "correct" itself, leading to uncomfortable manifestations:

- **Uncontrolled Healing:** His wounds close at inopportune times, sometimes before he can properly treat them
- **Empathic Suffering:** He feels echoes of others' pain when trying to heal them
- **Vitality Overflow:** His life force sometimes manifests visibly, causing his skin to flush with unnatural warmth or his eyes to glow faintly
- **Unwanted Persistence:** He struggles to stay unconscious even when it would be merciful, his body forcing him back to awareness

### Divine Connection (or Lack Thereof)
Rust has barely begun searching for answers. His power doesn't match the typical manifestations of any known god's blessing. He's asked questions in temples when he dared, searched for information in the few books he can access, but found nothing that matches his experience.

The closest he's come to understanding came during [[Events/Sevenarches Encounter|his encounter with Sevenarches]] a few months ago, where he sensed his curse was related to something **primordial**—forces that existed before gods, operating on rules that predate divine law.

He refuses to worship what he doesn't understand, seeing it as another form of submission. Instead, he treats his power as a tool, even if it's a tool that sometimes uses him. At 13, he's just starting this search for answers.

## History

### Early Life: The Monastery (Ages ~2-12)
Found as a toddler in the burned wreckage of a goblin encampment, Rust was taken to [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|the Monastery of the Golden Erinyes]], an austere Asmodean institution in western [[Locations/Isger|Isger]]. The [[Organizations/Sisters of the Golden Erinyes|Sisters]] ran a brutal program of "civilization" that was really just systematic abuse disguised as theology.

[[NPCs/Sister Malhana|Sister Malhana]] named him Rust for his coloring and worthlessness. [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] took particular interest in his "education," which involved frequent, methodical beatings justified by scripture. The monastery taught him that his existence was provisional, his value conditional on absolute obedience, and his suffering divinely mandated.

He endured this for roughly ten years, watching other children learn to see him as lesser, learning to read by candlelight between beatings, learning that mercy was weakness and questioning was sin.

### The Awakening (Age 12, One Year Ago)
After a particularly brutal beating for helping [[NPCs/Mika|another orphan]], Rust was left locked in the discipline chamber, broken and dying. That night, something **noticed** him. His power manifested for the first time, healing injuries that should have been fatal over the course of hours. The experience was terrifying and transformative—he realized this was both his salvation and his damnation. The Sisters would never let him go now.

He fled at dawn and never looked back.

### The Wandering Year (Age 12-13)
For the past year, Rust has moved north through [[Locations/Isger|Isger]] and into [[Locations/Druma|Druma]]. He's survived by:
- Taking odd jobs (stable work, farm labor, anything that pays)
- Offering basic healing services (downplaying his abilities)
- Staying ahead of questions
- Sleeping rough more often than not
- Learning survival skills through necessity

He discovered his affinity for animals during this time and it likely saved his life multiple times—animals don't ask questions, don't demand papers, and often led him to safe places to sleep.

A few months ago, he attempted to cut through [[Locations/Sevenarches|Sevenarches]] to save time. What happened there changed his understanding of his curse forever. The forest showed him truths he wasn't ready for and offered knowledge at too high a price. He fled and went around, adding weeks to his journey but keeping himself intact.

### Present Day (Age 13, Just Reached Adulthood)
Rust has just reached goblin adulthood (age 13). This milestone means:
- He's legally an adult by goblin standards
- He can take on more serious work
- He's starting to actively search for answers about his powers
- He's at the beginning of his journey, not years into it

He continues to wander, town to town, never settling. He heals who he can, helps where it's safe to help, and runs before anyone gets too curious. He's searching for answers he's not sure exist, trying to create meaning from a life that was supposed to be meaningless, and running from a past that taught him suffering was holy.

## Abilities & Skills

### Oracle Powers (Level 1)
- **Life Mystery:** Healing and protective magic drawn from an unknown primordial source
- **Revelation Spells:** Life-giving magic that sustains and restores (just learning to control)
- **Oracular Curse:** The burden of excessive, uncontrolled vitality
- **Unbreakable Heritage:** Fast healing 1 when dying, +2 to recovery checks

### Skills (Level 1)
- **Nature (Trained):** Understanding of animal behavior and wilderness survival
- **Stabling Lore (Trained):** Specific knowledge from his work experience
- **Medicine (Trained):** Practical healing knowledge from his year of practice
- **Religion (Trained):** Extensive knowledge from monastery education (though he rejects most of it)
- **Stealth (Untrained):** Essential skill for a goblin who needs to avoid notice
- **Diplomacy (Untrained):** Developing skill from talking his way out of trouble

### Languages
- Common
- Goblin
- Infernal (learned at the monastery, speaks it reluctantly)

## Relationships

### The Sisters of the Golden Erinyes
The source of his trauma and the reason he keeps moving. [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] in particular haunts his nightmares. He lives in constant low-level fear that they'll find him. See [[Organizations/Sisters of the Golden Erinyes|organization page]].

### Animals
His most reliable companions. He forms quick bonds with animals and they with him. In his year of wandering, he's briefly cared for stable horses, befriended stray dogs, and learned to read wildlife behavior. They don't judge him for being young, goblin, or cursed.

### The Vulnerable
Rust feels an instinctive protectiveness toward those who remind him of his younger self—the abused, the discarded, the ones deemed worthless by society. This sometimes overrides his survival instincts.

### Sevenarches
Not a relationship so much as an ongoing haunting. The forest **remembers** him from his encounter a few months ago, and he dreams of it still. Something there knows what he is and is waiting patiently for him to return. See [[Locations/Sevenarches|location page]].

### Other Escaped Orphans
Rust wonders constantly about [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]] and the others he left behind. He's too afraid to go back, but the guilt weighs on him.

## Goals & Motivations

### Immediate
- Survive day to day
- Find safe places to sleep
- Earn enough for food without drawing attention
- Avoid anyone who might recognize him
- Learn basic control of his powers

### Short-term (Now That He's Adult)
- Understand the source of his power
- Find someone who knows about oracles like him
- Get better at healing without revealing too much
- Maybe find a place to stay for more than a few days

### Long-term
- Understand his curse without paying the price [[Locations/Sevenarches|Sevenarches]] demanded
- Create meaning through action rather than accepting imposed purpose
- Perhaps, eventually, find somewhere he doesn't have to run from
- Maybe help others escape the [[Organizations/Sisters of the Golden Erinyes|Sisters]]

### Rejected Goals
- Worship or submission to his power's source
- Revenge against the Sisters (he's 13 and terrified of them)
- Understanding through [[Locations/Sevenarches|Sevenarches]] (the cost is too high)
- Going back to help [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]] (too dangerous, he tells himself)

## Fears & Vulnerabilities

### Psychological
- Deep-seated fear of confinement and helplessness
- Difficulty trusting adults or authority figures
- Nightmares of the monastery and [[Locations/Sevenarches|Sevenarches]]
- Fear that his curse will eventually consume his identity
- Guilt over leaving [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]] and others behind

### Practical
- Being recognized by anyone connected to the [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|monastery]]
- His young age makes him vulnerable to exploitation
- Limited resources and connections
- Doesn't fully understand his powers yet
- The temptation to return to [[Locations/Sevenarches|Sevenarches]] for answers

### Age-Related
- Still physically young and small, even for a goblin
- Limited life experience outside the monastery
- Naive about some aspects of the world
- Easily overwhelmed by complex social situations
- Sometimes makes impulsive decisions due to youth

## Character Development Notes

### Themes
- Coming of age while running from the past
- Survival vs. living
- Creating meaning from suffering without accepting that suffering has meaning
- The cost of knowledge and understanding
- Identity: what remains when everything else is stripped away
- Chosen purpose vs. imposed purpose
- Youth vs. forced maturity

### Potential Growth
- Learning to trust others (major character arc)
- Accepting help instead of always being self-sufficient
- Understanding his power without losing himself
- Finding a cause or people worth stopping for
- Processing trauma while still so young
- Growing from scared child to confident hero

### Open Questions
- What exactly noticed him that night in the monastery?
- Why was he preserved when other goblin children weren't?
- What would happen if he returned to [[Locations/Sevenarches|Sevenarches]]?
- Can he create genuine meaning, or is he still running from the Sisters' teachings?
- What happened to [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]]?
- Will he ever feel safe enough to stop running?

## Notes for Gameplay
- Rust is 13—play up both his competence AND his youth
- He's mature for his age but still makes impulsive decisions

*"I'm thirteen. The Sisters said that made me worthless even by goblin standards. But I escaped them, I survived alone, and I'm still here. Maybe that's worth something."*
