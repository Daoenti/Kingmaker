# Rust's Backstory

## Origins in Blood and Ash

Rust doesn't remember his birth name—if he ever had one. His earliest memories are of smoke, screaming, and the acrid smell of burning goblin settlements during the tail end of the Goblinblood Wars. He was found among the wreckage of a razed goblin encampment in Isger, a soot-covered whelp barely old enough to walk, by a patrol of Hellknights making their rounds through the scorched territories.

Most goblin orphans were put to the sword. Rust's survival was an accident of theology rather than mercy.

## The Sisters of the Golden Erinyes

The Sisters of the Golden Erinyes ran an austere monastery on Isger's western frontier, nominally dedicated to "civilizing" the region's goblinoid survivors through strict adherence to Asmodean doctrine. In practice, the Sisters saw goblin children as convenient subjects—beings whose suffering could be shaped into perfect obedience, living proof that even the lowest creatures could be broken and remade in Hell's image.

Rust was given his name by Sister Malhana, who noted his rust-colored skin and rust-red eyes with clinical detachment. "Even worthless metal can be beaten into something useful," she'd said.

The monastery's doctrine was simple: order through pain, salvation through submission. Rust learned his letters by candlelight, learned Infernal prayers with a switch across his knuckles for each mispronunciation, learned that his only value lay in absolute obedience. The other orphans—mostly human children from destitute families—learned to see him as lesser. The Sisters ensured it.

He was perhaps ten years old when Sister Velenne took particular interest in his "education." The beatings were frequent, methodical, always with justification drawn from scripture. _The body must be broken before the soul can be remade._ When he healed too slowly, she beat him for weakness. When he healed too quickly—which started happening around his twelfth year—she beat him for insolence, claiming he was being willfully stubborn.

## The Night Everything Changed

The night Rust fled came after Sister Velenne had beaten him with particular zeal. He'd been caught attempting to slip an extra portion of food to Mika, a younger human girl who'd been denied meals for crying during prayer. Velenne had dragged him to the discipline chamber and worked him over with her rod until he could barely see through the blood in his eyes.

She left him locked in the chamber overnight, a common practice—time to "contemplate your sins."

But something was different this time. As Rust lay on the cold stone floor, bones broken, ribs cracked, breath rattling in his chest, he felt _something_ stir inside him. Not from within, exactly—it felt like attention from somewhere else, something vast and incomprehensible noticing him for the first time. The pain didn't diminish, but his body began to knit itself together with a wrongness that terrified him. Bones ground back into place. Skin sealed over wounds. By dawn, he was whole.

And he understood, with perfect clarity, that this was the moment. If he could survive _this_, he could survive anything. The Sisters would never let him go—they'd study this new development, use it, break him further to test the limits of whatever this was.

So when the morning bell rang and the door was unlocked for the daily inspection of his penitence, Rust ran.

## The Long Road North

Survival came naturally to a goblin who'd been taught that his existence was provisional. Rust moved through Isger like smoke, stealing when he had to, working when he could, and always, always moving. The healing power remained—unpredictable, sometimes manifesting when he was in danger, sometimes arriving days too late to prevent suffering. He began to understand it wasn't _his_ power. Something had claimed him, though he didn't know what or why.

His path led north into Druma, where he discovered that Prophets of Kalistrade cared less about what you were and more about what you could pay. He sold his services as a healer in the merchant towns, working under false names, never staying longer than a few weeks. The curse—and it _was_ a curse, whatever it pretended to be—made him valuable, but it also made him noticeable. He learned to downplay what he could do, to present himself as merely competent rather than miraculous.

Through Druma's wealth-obsessed cities, he was just another laborer. Through Kyonin's border towns, he was just another outsider—elves barely distinguished between goblins and any other "lesser" races in their polite disdain. He learned to read people, learned which innkeepers would trade work for a room and which would call the guard the moment a goblin appeared at their door.

Sevenarches was where Rust learned true fear again. He'd planned to cut through the forest, but something in those woods _noticed_ him the same way the mysterious power had noticed him that night in the monastery. He circled wide around the region instead, losing two weeks to the detour, and never spoke of what he'd glimpsed in the shadows beneath those ancient trees.

## Present Day

Years have passed. Rust is hardened now, scarred in ways that don't show on his miraculously-healed skin. He still moves from town to town, still sells his healing services for food and board, still runs before anyone can ask too many questions. The power that sustains him remains alien—sometimes it whispers in dreams he can't quite remember, sometimes it shows him visions of suffering yet to come, sometimes it simply keeps him alive when he should have died.

He's searched for answers in temple libraries and roadside shrines, consulted with hedge witches and street-corner prophets. No god he's researched claims him. No curse he's studied matches his symptoms. He is unbreakable, but he doesn't know why, and he doesn't know what purpose he's being preserved for.

What Rust does know: the Sisters taught him that suffering has meaning, that pain serves a purpose in the cosmic order. He rejects this absolutely. If his curse lets him heal others, if his wandering takes him to people in need, then maybe—just maybe—he can create his own meaning. Not through submission to some unknowable power, but through spite. Through choosing, every single day, to be something other than what the Sisters tried to make him.

He's still running. But now, he's running _toward_ something, even if he doesn't yet know what it is.
