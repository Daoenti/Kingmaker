# Unknown Origins: Birth to Age 2

*Content Warning: This narrative deals with genocide, war, and the death of a child's family and community. While not graphically described, the subject matter is inherently dark.*

## The Void Before Memory

There was a time before the monastery. Before the Sisters. Before the name "Rust." A time that exists now only as absence—a blank space where a beginning should be.

Somewhere in [[Locations/Isger|Isger]], in the chaotic years during or just after the [[Events/Goblinblood Wars|Goblinblood Wars]], a goblin child was born. His parents held him. His tribe celebrated or mourned or simply noted his arrival with whatever customs they practiced. He had a name—his real name, the one his mother called him, the one that meant something in the language of his people.

That name is lost. The child who bore it doesn't remember. At thirteen, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] carries no memory of those first two years, no echo of his mother's voice, no fragment of his father's face. The Sisters took even that from him, though they likely never knew it was there to take.

## What We Know

The facts are sparse, clinical, preserved in monastery records that list him as "goblin foundling, approximate age 2, discovered in aftermath of purge operation, western Isger sector."

**The tribe:** Unknown. No identifying markers survived. No tribal colors or symbols remained on his small body when he was found. Whether they were a raiding tribe or peaceful gatherers, nomadic or settled, aggressive or defensive—all lost. Every adult who could have told him is dead.

**The parents:** Names unknown. Faces unknown. Whether they died fighting or fleeing or trying to hide their child—unknown. Whether they loved him in the fierce way parents love their children, whether they had hopes for what he might become—these are questions with no answers, only the ache of absence.

**His name:** Lost completely. Whatever sounds his parents made to call him to meals or comfort him when he cried—erased. The Sisters named him "Rust" for his coloring, for his worthlessness, never knowing or caring that they were completing an act of cultural annihilation begun by swords and fire.

**The date:** Uncertain. Record-keeping during the Goblinblood Wars was inconsistent, especially for "successful purge operations." He was found as a toddler, which places his birth somewhere in the chaos of genocide. The exact year doesn't matter to the monastery; goblin children don't warrant precise documentation.

## What Happened (Reconstruction)

This is speculation, assembled from fragments—what Rust learned in monastery history lessons, what can be inferred from the circumstances of his discovery, what must have been true for him to survive:

### Before the End

Somewhere in western Isger, a goblin community existed. Perhaps they had been there for generations. Perhaps they were refugees from the wars, hoping to hide until the killing stopped. They lived as goblins live—with their own customs, their own language, their own understanding of the world.

A child was born to this community. In goblin culture, children are precious—tribes have high infant mortality, and every child who survives represents hope for the future. This child, rust-colored even then, was likely celebrated. His parents probably had plans for him. His extended family probably doted on him in the way families do.

For approximately two years, he was simply a goblin child in a goblin community. He learned to walk, to make sounds that would become words, to recognize his parents' faces. He ate what goblins eat, slept where goblins sleep, was held when he cried, laughed at things that made goblin children laugh.

He was **home**.

### The End

Then the Chelaxians came.

Perhaps it was a military operation. Perhaps it was a civilian militia looking to make names for themselves by killing goblins. Perhaps it was Hellknights conducting a "purification sweep." The exact force doesn't matter—the result was the same.

They came with fire and steel. Goblin communities, even defensive ones, rarely survived such encounters. The adults would have fought or fled. The children would have been hidden or carried. The community would have scattered, tried to escape, tried to survive.

Almost none did.

### The Discovery

In the aftermath—the burned structures, the bodies, the ash—a Chelaxian patrol found a single survivor.

A toddler. Approximately two years old. Rust-colored skin. Somehow alive amid the carnage. 

Perhaps he'd been hidden in a root cellar or storage pit. Perhaps his parents had covered him with their own bodies. Perhaps he'd simply been overlooked in the initial violence, too small to notice among the chaos. The exact mechanism of his survival is unknown.

What is known: he was found alive, uninjured, terrified, and completely alone.

### The Choice

Standard protocol during the Goblinblood Wars was straightforward: goblin children were killed along with the adults. The reasoning was documented in military orders: "Goblin children become goblin raiders. Eliminate the problem at its source."

But this patrol—for reasons lost to history—made a different choice. Perhaps an officer had religious scruples about killing a toddler in cold blood. Perhaps someone thought the child could be useful. Perhaps someone felt an unexpected flicker of mercy.

They brought him to the [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|Monastery of the Golden Erinyes]].

This decision saved his life. It also guaranteed a different kind of death—the slow erasure of everything he had been, everything he might have become in his own culture, everyone who had loved him before.

## The Gap

Between the burning of his community and his arrival at the monastery lies a period of unknown length. Was it days? Weeks? What happened to a traumatized two-year-old in the custody of soldiers who had just killed his family?

He was too young to remember. His first clear memories begin at the monastery around age four or five. These missing weeks or months exist only as void.

What we know is that by the time he arrived at the monastery:
- He was physically healthy (no major injuries)
- He was terrified of adults (understandable)
- He no longer spoke Goblin, or if he did, he quickly learned not to
- He had survived something that broke something in him, even if he can't consciously access the memory

## What Was Lost

By the time [[NPCs/Sister Malhana|Sister Malhana]] named him "Rust," he had already lost:

**Language:** His first language, Goblin, though he'd later relearn it as a foreign tongue in monastery classes about "knowing the enemy."

**Culture:** Whatever customs, stories, songs, and traditions his tribe practiced. Whatever made them specifically *them*.

**Identity:** His birth name. His family lineage. His place in a community that knew and valued him for himself.

**Love:** Whatever love his parents felt for him, whatever affection his extended family showed. The foundational knowledge that he was wanted, welcomed, treasured.

**Context:** Any understanding of why he was spared when others weren't. Any explanation for what happened. Any way to make sense of surviving.

**Memory:** Even the ability to remember what was taken. At thirteen, he knows intellectually that he had parents, a tribe, a life before. But he cannot *remember* it. He grieved for abstractions, not for people he can picture.

## The Cruel Mathematics of Survival

Here is the bitter irony that [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] doesn't yet fully understand at thirteen:

He survived the purge by chance. He survived the immediate aftermath by someone's decision not to kill a toddler. He survived the journey by being young enough to seem harmless. He survived the monastery by being too stubborn to break.

But survival is not victory. Every act of survival cost him something:

- He survived the purge, but his family died
- He survived the journey, but lost his memories
- He survived the monastery, but lost his childhood
- He survived by being exceptional, but being exceptional made him a target

At thirteen, he's beginning to understand this mathematics. Every time someone says "you survived, you should be grateful," something in him recoils. He survived. Others didn't. That's not virtue or blessing—it's chance and cruelty.

## What Rust Knows at Thirteen

When he thinks about his first two years (which is rarely, because it hurts), [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] knows:

**Facts:**
- He came from somewhere
- He had parents who are dead
- He had a tribe that was destroyed
- He was found in the aftermath
- He was approximately two years old

**Absences:**
- His birth name (he dreams sometimes of hearing it called)
- His parents' faces (he tries to imagine them and sees only generic goblins)
- Whether he had siblings
- What his tribe was like
- Whether anyone searched for him
- Whether anyone besides his parents mourned his loss

**Questions:**
- Did his parents die protecting him?
- Did they know he survived?
- Would they recognize what he became?
- What would his life have been in his tribe?
- What was his real name?
- Who was he supposed to be?

**Grief:**
He grieves for people he can't remember. He grieves for a life he never got to live. He grieves for the child who had a name and a home and a future, who died in that fire even though his body survived.

Sometimes, late at night, he tries to remember. Tries to push his memory back before the monastery, before the stone walls and the prayers and Sister Velenne's rod. He searches for any scrap—a smell, a sound, a feeling of safety.

There's nothing there. Just void. Just absence. Just the knowledge that something was taken that can never be returned.

## The Weight of Unknowing

At thirteen, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] carries this unknowing like a physical weight. Other people have origins. They know where they came from, who their parents were, what their names mean. They have stories about their grandparents, recipes from their culture, lullabies in their native tongue.

He has nothing. Just "goblin foundling, approximate age 2."

The Sisters told him this was mercy. That he was lucky to be spared. That he should be grateful for his "salvation" from his savage origins. They taught him his people were monsters, barely better than animals, deserving of extermination.

He never believed them. Even as a child, even through the worst of it, some part of him knew: the people who burned villages and killed children were not the ones who got to define "monster."

But not believing them doesn't give him back what was taken. He'll never know his real name. He'll never hear his mother's voice. He'll never know what kind of person he was supposed to become.

He is [[Characters/Rust|Rust]], named by his abusers, shaped by his trauma, defined by his survival. The child he was born as is gone, as dead as his parents, as lost as his tribe.

That child's ghost follows him. In quiet moments, he feels its presence—the absence of something that should be there, the weight of grief for someone he never got to be.

## The Beginning That Wasn't

Most people's lives begin with family, with love, with belonging. Most people carry their origins with them, for good or ill, as a foundation.

[[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s life began with annihilation. His foundation is absence. His origin story is a void.

When he was found in that burned village, when that patrol made the choice to spare him, his life was saved. But the life he was living—the life as that goblin child with his real name in his own community—ended.

Everything that came after—the monastery, the abuse, the awakening, the wandering—all of it happened to a child who had already lost everything before he was old enough to remember having it.

This is where his story begins: with ending. With loss. With a two-year-old standing alone in the ashes, unnamed, unmourned, saved by people who would spend the next ten years teaching him that saving him was more cruelty than kindness.

At thirteen, he understands this in a way he couldn't at two, or five, or even ten. His survival began with genocide. His life began with death. His identity began with erasure.

And somehow, despite all of it, despite the void where his origins should be, despite carrying the weight of all that unknowing—

He is still here. Still trying. Still searching for a way to build something from nothing, to create meaning from absence, to be more than just a survivor of an unnamed tragedy.

The child he was born as is gone forever. The child the monastery tried to create never really existed. Somewhere between those two voids, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] is trying to figure out who he actually is.

That search began in ashes, in unknowing, in loss.

But it's his search. His story. His chance to become someone neither his dead parents nor his abusive captors could have imagined.

The void is where he came from.

It is not where he's going.

## Historical Context

**The Goblinblood Wars** were a series of conflicts in [[Locations/Isger|Isger]] where goblinoid tribes and Chelaxian/Isgeri forces clashed repeatedly. The wars were characterized by brutality on all sides, but the systematic nature of "purge operations" against goblin populations constituted what many scholars would later recognize as genocide.

**Standard Protocols** called for complete elimination of goblin communities, including children. The logic was coldly practical: goblin children would grow into goblin raiders. Better to solve the problem permanently.

**Exceptions** like Rust's survival were rare but not unknown. Religious institutions sometimes claimed goblin children for "civilizing" programs. Whether this was more merciful than the alternative is a question without comfortable answers.

## A Note on Memory

Psychological research suggests that explicit memories typically don't form before ages 2-4, and traumatic amnesia can erase even those early fragments. Rust's lack of memory from before age 4-5 is consistent with both normal development and trauma response.

He lost his origins twice: once in the fire that killed his tribe, and again in the natural forgetting of early childhood. The cruelty is that he knows something was there, knows it was taken, but cannot remember what he lost.

This is perhaps the deepest wound: to grieve for something you cannot name, to miss people you cannot picture, to long for a home you cannot remember ever having.

*"Sometimes I try to remember them. My parents. My real name. Anything from before. But there's nothing there—just this absence, this gap where a beginning should be. The Sisters said I should be grateful they saved me. But you can't save someone from their own life. You can only take it away and call it mercy."* - Rust, age 13, in a rare moment of openness
