# Arrival and Early Conditioning: Ages 2-5

*Content Warning: This narrative deals with institutional abuse of a young child, systematic dehumanization, and the psychological conditioning of a toddler. While not graphically violent, the subject matter involves the deliberate infliction of suffering on a very young child.*

---

## The Arrival (Age 2)

The first thing the toddler noticed about the [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|Monastery of the Golden Erinyes]] was the cold.

Not the temperature—though the stone halls were colder than anything in his brief memory—but something else. A cold that came from the building itself, from the eyes of the women in dark robes, from the absolute stillness that pressed down on everything like a physical weight.

He didn't know words for it yet. He was barely two years old, traumatized, terrified, and alone. But some instinct, some animal awareness of danger, made him go very quiet when the soldiers handed him over to the Sisters.

The woman who took him—[[NPCs/Sister Malhana|Sister Malhana]], though he wouldn't learn her name for years—looked down at him with eyes that held no warmth. She made a notation in a heavy book, her pen scratching across parchment with methodical precision.

"Goblin foundling," she said, her voice flat. "Approximate age two. No identifying marks of value. Rust-colored. We'll call him Rust."

Just like that, his name—his real name, the one his mother called him, the one that meant something in his own language—was gone. Replaced with a word that meant corrosion, decay, worthlessness.

She handed him to another Sister, this one younger, who carried him down a long corridor. The toddler didn't cry. He was too frightened to cry, too overwhelmed by the strangeness of everything—the echoing footsteps, the smell of incense that would come to nauseate him, the sound of prayers drifting from somewhere deeper in the building.

The Sister brought him to a dormitory. Twenty narrow beds lined the walls. A single window, high up and barred, let in weak light. The other children—all human, all older—stopped what they were doing to stare at the goblin child.

"This is where you'll sleep," the Sister said, pointing to a bed near the door. "The rules are simple: obey, be silent, and remember that you exist here by mercy alone."

She left. The door locked behind her.

The other children continued to stare. The goblin toddler—now Rust, though he wouldn't understand that for a while—stood by his assigned bed and tried not to shake.

He didn't know it yet, but this was mercy. This was salvation. This was the beginning of his "education."

This was the first day of ten years that would break him and rebuild him and break him again until he learned to escape or ceased to exist as anything recognizable.

At two years old, standing in that cold dormitory, he could not have understood any of this.

But his body knew. Some deep, preverbal part of him recognized that he had left one kind of danger—the danger of fire and death—and entered another.

This danger was patient. Systematic. Sanctified.

And it would last much, much longer.

## First Memories (Ages 2-3)

[[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s first clear memories are fragments, images without context, sensations without explanation:

**The bed near the door.**
Cold. Always cold. A draft came from the poorly fitted door, making his thin blanket useless most nights. He learned quickly that this was not an accident. The coldest bed was for the goblin. The smallest portions of food were for the goblin. The hardest work was for the goblin.

At two and three, he didn't understand *why*. He only knew that he was different, and different meant worse.

**The sound of crying.**
Other children cried at night. The first time he cried—missing something he couldn't name, frightened by nightmares of fire—a Sister came in. She didn't comfort him. She beat him silent.

He learned fast. Crying brought pain. Crying disturbed the others. Crying was forbidden.

By age three, he had learned to cry silently, face pressed into his mattress, making no sound that would summon punishment.

**The prayers.**
Hours of kneeling. Words he didn't understand in a language he didn't speak. The other children knew when to stand, when to kneel, when to recite. He didn't. He copied their movements, tried to mouth the sounds, and was beaten when he got it wrong.

The prayers were in Common, though he'd later learn they invoked [[Deities/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]]—god of tyranny, slavery, and contracts written in suffering. At two and three, he understood none of this. He only understood: kneel when they kneel. Stand when they stand. Move your lips even if no sound comes out.

**The hunger.**
Always hungry. The portions given to him were smaller than what the human children received. Sometimes, if he'd been punished, he received no food at all. His body, small even for a goblin, stayed thin and underfed.

He learned to eat slowly, to make each bite last, to savor every scrap. He learned to watch the other children eat better food and show no reaction. Wanting more was punishable. Complaining about hunger was punishable. Even looking too long at someone else's plate was punishable.

**The chamber pots.**
One of his earliest jobs: emptying the dormitory's chamber pots. At three years old, barely able to carry the heavy buckets, he hauled waste to the cesspit behind the monastery. The other children were spared this task. It was work for the goblin.

He learned to breathe through his mouth. Learned to walk carefully so he didn't spill. Learned that spilling meant cleaning it with his bare hands while a Sister watched to ensure he understood the consequences of carelessness.

**The silence.**
Everything was silent. Meals were silent. Prayer was recited but not discussed. Work was done without conversation. The dormitory after lockdown was absolutely quiet.

He learned to be silent. Learned that his voice had no value. Learned that speaking without permission meant punishment, that questions meant punishment, that making any sound at all was dangerous.

By age three, he was fluent in silence. It was his first language in this new world.

## Learning the Rules (Ages 3-4)

As he grew from toddler to young child, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] began to understand the structure of his new world. The monastery operated on a rigid hierarchy, and he was at the bottom:

**At the top:** The Sisters, servants of [[Deities/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]], enforcers of order, absolute in their authority.

**Below them:** The human orphans, "charity cases" being educated and disciplined but ultimately destined for better lives as servants or laborers.

**At the very bottom:** Him. The goblin. The creature. The example of what happens when mercy is extended to those who don't deserve it.

The rules were never explicitly explained. He learned them through trial and error, through punishment, through watching what happened to him versus what happened to the human children:

### Rule One: Obey Immediately
Hesitation was defiance. Questions were defiance. Any delay between command and compliance was defiance.

He learned to move the instant a Sister spoke, to drop whatever he was doing, to reconfigure his entire understanding of priority in a heartbeat. The Sisters' will was absolute. Everything else—his comfort, his needs, his understanding—was irrelevant.

### Rule Two: Accept Your Place
He was lesser. This was not cruelty; this was simply fact, as immutable as the rising sun. The human children were taught to see him as beneath them. He was taught to agree.

At three and four, he internalized this lesson without the cognitive tools to resist it. Of course he was lesser. Everyone said so. Everyone treated him as such. How could he, a small goblin child, know better than every adult and child around him?

### Rule Three: Gratitude Is Mandatory
He should be grateful. Grateful for food, even when it was insufficient. Grateful for shelter, even when it was cold. Grateful for education, even when it was delivered with blows. Grateful for survival, even when survival felt worse than the alternative.

The Sisters reminded him constantly: he could have been killed with the rest. His existence was a gift. Any suffering he endured was nothing compared to the mercy of being allowed to live.

At four years old, he believed them. Why wouldn't he? They were adults. They were authorities. They claimed to speak for god himself. How could they be wrong?

### Rule Four: Pain Is Instructive
Punishment wasn't cruelty—it was education. The rod taught lessons that words alone could not. Suffering refined the spirit. Discipline shaped character.

When he was beaten for mistakes, this was instruction. When he was denied food, this was teaching him temperance. When he was locked in dark places, this was showing him the consequences of disobedience.

The Sisters had a hundred aphorisms about this. "Spare the rod, spoil the child." "Through suffering, wisdom." "Pain is the teacher; obedience is the lesson."

By age four, he accepted this as truth. When he hurt, it was because he'd done something wrong. When he was punished, he deserved it. The fault was always his.

### Rule Five: Never Complain
Complaints were evidence of insufficient gratitude. Questions were evidence of insufficient humility. Any expression of discomfort or pain or need was evidence of corruption.

He learned to endure in silence. Learned to show no reaction to cold or hunger or pain. Learned that even his face could betray him—a wince at the wrong moment could trigger punishment for insolence.

By age four, his face had learned stillness. His body had learned to show no weakness. His voice had learned that the safest sound was no sound at all.

## Daily Life (Ages 4-5)

By age five, the structure of [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s days had calcified into brutal routine:

### Dawn (5:00 AM)
The bell. Loud, jarring, designed to shock children from sleep. The dormitory door unlocking. Five minutes to dress, make the bed with perfect corners, and stand at attention.

At five years old, he could barely reach the top of his mattress. Making military-precise bed corners took him longer than the human children. He learned to wake before the bell, to work in darkness, to have the bed made when the Sister came to inspect.

Failure meant no breakfast. He could not afford to fail.

### Morning Prayers (5:15-7:15 AM)
Two hours kneeling on stone floor in the chapel. At five, his knees were too small, his bones too soft. The pain was constant and sharp. But showing pain was weakness.

He learned to recite the prayers in Common. Learned the cadence, the rhythm, the points where everyone stood or sat or knelt. He still didn't understand most of the words. They were sounds to be memorized and repeated, like a bird might repeat sounds without comprehension.

The prayers praised [[Deities/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]]: god of law, hierarchy, tyranny. They praised order above mercy, discipline above kindness, strength above compassion. They taught that suffering was divine instruction, that obedience was the highest virtue, that questioning authority was the deepest sin.

At five, he believed every word. Why wouldn't he?

### Breakfast (7:15-7:30 AM)
Fifteen minutes of silent eating. Thin gruel for the children, thicker porridge for the Sisters. His portion was smallest—barely enough to quiet the constant gnawing in his stomach.

He ate slowly, trying to make it last. Watched other children get seconds and learned not to want. Learned that hunger was his constant companion, as much a part of daily life as prayer or cold.

### Morning Work (7:30 AM - Noon)
For the human children: age-appropriate chores, shared among many. For Rust: whatever was hardest, dirtiest, most exhausting.

At five years old, he:
- Hauled water from the well (buckets half his size)
- Emptied chamber pots (his most regular task)
- Scrubbed floors on hands and knees
- Cleaned fireplaces (covered in ash and soot)
- Hauled laundry to the washing room
- Carried trash to disposal pits

The work was too heavy for a five-year-old. He struggled. He exhausted himself. But complaining was forbidden, and showing fatigue was weakness.

He learned to work beyond his capacity. Learned that his body would do things he thought impossible if the alternative was punishment. Learned that childhood was something other children had.

### Midday Break (Noon-12:30 PM)
Watery soup, a crust of bread if he'd worked well enough. Thirty minutes of silence. No play, no rest, just enough time to not collapse.

### Afternoon (12:30-3:00 PM)
More work, but occasionally varied. Sometimes he was allowed in the garden—that was the best time, when he could see sky and feel sunlight. Sometimes he was assigned to kitchen help, where he could steal scraps if no one was watching.

Most days, though: more hauling, more scrubbing, more emptying waste, more working until his small body screamed for rest.

### Evening Prayers (6:00-7:30 PM)
Another hour and a half of kneeling. His knees developed permanent calluses. His back learned to hold positions that should have been impossible. His mind learned to drift while his mouth recited prayers his heart never meant.

### Dinner (7:30-8:00 PM)
Soup again. Bread if he'd been good. Nothing if he'd transgressed. Thirty minutes of silence and hunger and exhaustion.

### Contemplation (8:00-9:00 PM)
Sitting in absolute silence, supposedly reflecting on sins and lessons. For a five-year-old who'd worked fourteen hours, this was torture of a different kind—being forced to stay awake and still when every part of him wanted to collapse.

### Lockdown (9:00 PM)
Back to the dormitory. Door locked. Absolute silence enforced. He learned to fall asleep instantly, knowing dawn would come too soon.

Eight hours until the bell rang again. Eight hours that were never enough to fully recover.

Then repeat. Every day. Every week. Every month.

This was his life at five years old.

## The Human Children (Ages 3-5)

The other orphans were [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s first peers and his first enemies, though neither they nor he had chosen this role.

**The older ones** (ages 8-12 when he arrived) learned quickly that the Sisters rewarded those who helped enforce hierarchy. Mocking the goblin, pushing him, reporting his small infractions—these actions earned praise and occasionally extra food.

Some of them were cruel because they'd been taught cruelty. Some were cruel because they were children in a brutal place and he was an acceptable target. Some were cruel because cruelty to him meant they weren't at the bottom.

He learned not to turn his back on them. Learned that they would trip him, take his sparse belongings, blame him for their mistakes. Learned that appealing to them for help or kindness was pointless.

**The younger ones** (ages 3-7) learned from the older children that Rust was lesser. They copied the behavior they saw modeled, the hierarchy they were taught. Even children younger than him called him "creature" or "goblin" with casual contempt.

Some of them were uncomfortable with this. He could see it sometimes—a flicker of uncertainty when the older children were particularly cruel. But they never acted on that uncertainty. Defending the goblin meant becoming a target yourself.

**None of them** were friends. None offered kindness. None questioned why the small goblin child was worked harder, fed less, punished more severely for the same infractions.

They were children too. Children shaped by the same system that was shaping him. But knowing this didn't make their cruelty hurt less.

By age five, Rust had learned a terrible lesson: he was alone. Not just physically alone in a dormitory full of other children, but fundamentally, existentially alone. No one would help him. No one would defend him. No one would see his suffering and care.

This lesson went deeper than the beatings, deeper than the hunger. It taught him that his pain didn't matter, that his existence was conditional, that even children—who should have been allies in shared powerlessness—had learned to see him as less than human.

He stopped hoping for friendship. Stopped looking for kindness in their faces. Learned to expect nothing and be unsurprised when nothing was what he received.

## Sister Malhana (Ages 2-5)

[[NPCs/Sister Malhana|Sister Malhana]] was not the cruelest Sister. That distinction would later belong to [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Velenne]]. But Malhana was the architect of his early conditioning, the one who established his place in the monastery's hierarchy.

She was the one who named him Rust. The one who assigned him the worst bed, the smallest portions, the hardest work. The one who taught the other children that treating him as lesser was correct and proper.

She was methodical, precise, administrative. Cruelty for her wasn't personal—it was policy. She documented everything in her ledgers: his infractions, his punishments, his failure to meet standards set impossibly high.

"You exist here by mercy," she told him once when he was four, after beating him for crying during prayers. "Remember that. Every moment you draw breath is a gift. The fact that you suffer in return is more than fair."

She meant it. In her worldview, shaped by Asmodean doctrine, hierarchy was divine mandate. That he was at the bottom wasn't cruelty—it was proper order. That he suffered wasn't abuse—it was education.

To her, he wasn't a traumatized child. He was a project. An experiment in whether a goblin could be civilized through sufficient discipline. She took notes on his progress, recorded his responses to various punishments, documented his development with the same detachment she might use for any other monastery function.

She never raised her voice. Never showed anger. Just cold, methodical enforcement of rules designed to break him into useful pieces.

By age five, he feared her—not for dramatic violence but for the systematic nature of her cruelty. She never forgot an infraction. Never showed mercy. Never acknowledged that he was a small child being worked to exhaustion.

She was, in many ways, the perfect embodiment of what the monastery stood for: order without mercy, discipline without compassion, hierarchy without humanity.

## First Conscious Memories (Age 5)

Around age five, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s memories shifted from fragments to something more continuous. He began to retain not just images but sequences, not just sensations but context.

This is also when he began to understand that something was wrong.

**The first moment of consciousness:**
He was scrubbing the chapel floor, alone, working on hands and knees with a brush and cold water. His hands were raw. His back hurt. He'd been working for hours.

And for the first time, a thought formed clearly in his mind: *This is too hard. I'm too small for this.*

Not revolutionary. Not even particularly profound. But it was the first time he'd questioned whether what was happening to him was normal, reasonable, fair.

He pushed the thought away immediately. Of course it was fair. He was the goblin. This was his place. The Sisters said so.

But the thought had formed. The seed of doubt had been planted.

**The second moment:**
A human child, maybe six years old, was given a larger portion at dinner. Rust's stomach twisted with hunger, and another thought surfaced: *Why? We did the same work. Why does he get more?*

Again, he pushed it away. But the question remained, small and persistent at the back of his mind.

**The third moment:**
Sister Malhana was beating him for some minor infraction—talking during work hours, maybe, or failing to finish an impossible task. And while the rod fell, while pain exploded across his shoulders, another thought: *I didn't deserve this. I worked hard. I tried.*

This thought frightened him more than the beating. Questioning the Sisters' judgment was sin. Thinking himself undeserving of punishment was pride. These thoughts were dangerous.

But they kept coming.

By age five, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] was beginning to wake up. Beginning to see the monastery not just as the natural order of things, but as something constructed, something that could be questioned.

He wasn't ready to act on this awareness. He was five years old, utterly powerless, completely dependent on his abusers for survival. But the awareness was there, growing like a crack in a foundation.

The Sisters had taught him he was worthless. Taught him he deserved suffering. Taught him gratitude for abuse.

But some stubborn part of him—the part that survived when his tribe died, the part that endured three years of systematic degradation—was starting to wonder if they were wrong.

## The Cost (Ages 2-5)

By age five, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] had learned to survive. But survival cost him:

**Childhood:** While human five-year-olds played, explored, tested boundaries, learned through joy—he worked, obeyed, endured, learned through pain.

**Trust:** Every adult was a threat. Every authority figure was an enemy. Trust was weakness.

**Expression:** His face had learned stillness. His voice had learned silence. His body had learned to show no reaction to suffering.

**Identity:** He'd forgotten his real name. Forgotten his language. Forgotten his culture. "Rust" was all he had, and "Rust" was a name that meant worthlessness.

**Normalcy:** He didn't know that children should play, should be protected, should be cherished. He thought all children lived like this. He thought this was what childhood was.

**Hope:** He'd learned not to hope for better. Hope was dangerous. Acceptance was survival.

But he'd gained something too, though he wouldn't recognize it for years:

**Endurance:** The ability to survive impossible hardship.

**Observation:** Hypervigilance born of necessity—he noticed everything, remembered everything, learned patterns others missed.

**Stubbornness:** That small, unbreakable core that kept him alive. That refused, despite everything, to completely believe what they said about him.

**Compassion:** Watching cruelty didn't make him cruel. Suffering didn't make him inflict suffering. Somehow, through all of it, he learned to be gentle.

At five years old, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] was a child shaped by trauma but not yet broken by it. The monastery had three more years of relatively "gentle" conditioning before [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] took special interest. Three more years before the real testing began.

But the foundation was laid. He knew his place. Knew his worthlessness. Knew that survival meant obedience, silence, and endurance.

What the monastery didn't know—what he didn't yet know himself—was that foundation had cracks.

And cracks, given time and pressure, can become breaks.

And breaks can become escapes.

*"My first clear memory is scrubbing the chapel floor. I was five. My hands were bleeding. I remember thinking it hurt, and then immediately thinking I shouldn't think that, because if I thought it hurt that meant I was weak. They taught me to police my own thoughts before I even knew what thoughts were."* - Rust, age 13
