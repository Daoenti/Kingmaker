# Mapping Freedom: Ages 8-9

*Content Warning: This narrative deals with a child developing survival strategies in response to ongoing abuse, including dissociation techniques and the psychological toll of living in constant fear.*

## The Shift from Endurance to Planning

Something changed in [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] between age eight and nine. Not a dramatic moment—no sudden revelation or breaking point. Rather, a slow crystallization of purpose beneath the surface of daily survival.

He'd spent six years learning to endure: how to make his face blank, his body still, his mind somewhere else when the pain came. Endurance was necessary, but it was passive. A plant growing in poor soil, surviving but not thriving.

Now, gradually, almost without conscious decision, endurance transformed into something more dangerous: preparation.

He didn't know when he might escape. He didn't even know if escape was possible. But he began preparing anyway, with the methodical patience of someone who understands that survival sometimes requires years of work for a single uncertain opportunity.

## Mental Mapping

It started with the gardens.

[[04 - Velennes Observation|Garden work]] had always been Rust's preferred punishment detail—outdoors, away from the Sisters' direct supervision, surrounded by living things that didn't demand his degradation. But during his eighth year, he began paying attention to the gardens differently.

Not just as a space to work, but as a map to memorize.

*That's the south wall,* he noted, pulling weeds near the perimeter. *Ten feet high, stone, but the mortar's crumbling in three places. Footholds there, there, and there.*

*The gate Sister Malhana uses for supply deliveries. Opens twice per week—Tuesday mornings, Friday afternoons. Always two Sisters to receive deliveries. Both distracted for approximately seven minutes during inventory.*

*The old garden shed in the northeast corner. Door doesn't lock properly—I could hide there if needed. Contains tools. A hand rake could serve as a weapon in desperate circumstances.*

He didn't write any of this down. Writing would have been evidence, and evidence was dangerous. Instead, he built mental maps—detailed, three-dimensional models of every space he could access, updated constantly with new observations.

The monastery chapel: seventeen columns, eight windows (two accessible from the balcony), three exits (but only one unlocked during services). Average number of Sisters present at morning prayers: twelve. At evening prayers: nine. Late night prayers: three.

The dormitory: twenty-two beds, four lanterns, two doors. The northwest door squeaked. The southeast one didn't. The floorboard near the third bed from the window was loose—could be lifted to hide small items if necessary. The window opened six inches before the lock caught, but the lock was corroded—might break with sufficient force.

The scriptorium, the refectory, the punishment cells, the Sister's quarters—every space he could observe, he mapped. Every routine he could identify, he memorized. Every vulnerability in the monastery's security, he noted and filed away.

*Why are you doing this?* some part of him wondered. *You're eight years old. You have no resources, no allies, no plan.*

But another part answered: *Because when opportunity comes—if it comes—I need to be ready. Because mapping freedom, even if I never reach it, is better than not knowing where it is. Because preparation is resistance, and resistance is hope.*

## The Garden as Sanctuary

The monastery gardens became more than a place to map. They became his sanctuary, the one location where he could almost breathe.

Sister Malhana supervised garden work most days, and while she was no friend to the children, she was also less actively cruel than [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]]. In the gardens, the other Sisters seemed to forget about him for hours at a time. He could work in relative peace, his hands in soil, his mind temporarily free from hypervigilance.

The gardens taught him things the monastery never intended:

**Patience.** Seeds didn't sprout because you demanded it. Plants grew at their own pace, according to their own nature. Sometimes Rust felt like those seeds—planted in terrible soil, struggling toward light, growing despite everything trying to stunt him.

**Resilience.** Some plants died easily. Others kept coming back, no matter how often they were cut down. The monastery kept a small patch of mint in the herb garden, and that mint was indestructible. Pull it up entirely, and it would regrow from a fragment of root left behind. Rust found this deeply encouraging.

**Hidden strength.** The most fragile-looking flowers sometimes had root systems that went astonishingly deep. You couldn't see their strength from the surface, but it was there, anchoring them against storms. Rust understood this. He appeared weak and broken on the surface. But underneath, he was developing roots they couldn't see—knowledge, strategies, determination that ran deeper than any Sister suspected.

By age nine, Rust could identify every plant in the monastery gardens by sight and smell. He knew which herbs were medicinal, which ones were poisonous, which ones could be eaten if he ever found himself starving in the wilderness. He knew the growing cycles, the water requirements, the seasonal patterns.

The Sisters thought they were teaching him gardening as a useful skill for servants. They were actually teaching him botany, agriculture, and survival skills for life outside monastery walls.

## Small Acts of Reclamation

Resistance, for a powerless child, couldn't be dramatic. It had to be small, invisible, sustainable. Acts so minor that even if discovered, they couldn't be punished because they barely qualified as transgression.

Rust developed a repertoire of tiny rebellions:

**Renaming things.** The Sisters called the punishment cells "reflection chambers." In his private thoughts, Rust called them what they were: torture rooms. The "character building exercises" were abuse. "Discipline" was cruelty. Keeping his own vocabulary was keeping his own truth.

**Helping others invisibly.** When another child was punished, Rust would slip them food later if he could. When someone was sick, he'd share his blanket at night. When the new children arrived confused and terrified, he'd whisper explanations when the Sisters weren't watching. He couldn't save anyone—he could barely save himself—but he could make survival fractionally less terrible for others.

**Protecting his mind.** During Sister Velenne's "lessons," he learned to keep part of himself separate. To make his body available for her experiments while his mind retreated to a place she couldn't touch. He'd map the monastery, or conjugate Goblin verbs, or mentally solve mathematical problems. Anything to preserve some core of himself that remained his own.

**Strategic incompetence.** Some tasks he deliberately did wrong. Not obviously enough to invite severe punishment, but poorly enough that he'd rarely be assigned them again. Tasks that involved cleaning the Sisters' personal quarters, for example—better to appear clumsy and be assigned to the gardens instead. He learned to fail selectively, steering his punishment details toward the least harmful options.

These weren't the actions of someone merely surviving. They were the actions of someone who refused to be completely conquered, even when conquest seemed inevitable and total.

## The Mathematics of Freedom

Rust's education continued, and with it, his understanding of how systems worked.

Mathematics taught him about patterns, sequences, probabilities. If Sister Velenne conducted experiments on him every six days on average, with a standard deviation of two days, he could predict windows of relative safety. If morning prayers lasted forty-seven minutes on average, he knew when he could expect to be unsupervised.

History taught him how empires fell. Always the same pattern: they grew too confident, too rigid, too convinced of their own permanence. Then something unexpected happened—a weak point exploited, an overlooked vulnerability, a slave revolt no one saw coming. The [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|monastery]] was an empire of thirty people. Small empires were often the most vulnerable.

Geography taught him about the world beyond monastery walls. [[Locations/Isger|Isger]], where he'd come from. The nations beyond it. The forests, mountains, cities, roads. Escape wouldn't mean freedom if he didn't know where to go. So he memorized maps, trade routes, the locations of other settlements. When the time came—if it came—he needed to know which direction to run.

Sister Velenne thought she was educating him to be useful. She was right, just not in the way she imagined. Every skill she taught him, every fact she forced him to learn, every book she gave him access to—all of it became ammunition. Knowledge he could use against his captors if he ever got the chance.

## The Long Game

By age nine, Rust had internalized something crucial: escape, if it happened, would require perfect timing and years of preparation.

He couldn't overpower adult humans. He couldn't pick locks he'd never practiced on. He couldn't survive in the wilderness without skills and knowledge. He couldn't run blindly and hope for success—that way led to recapture or death.

But he could prepare. He could learn. He could map every detail of the monastery until he knew it better than the Sisters themselves. He could develop survival skills disguised as punishment labor. He could stay alert for opportunities while appearing docile and defeated.

The Sisters saw a broken goblin child, increasingly compliant, appropriately terrified, serving his function. They saw what they expected to see.

They didn't see the mental maps being drawn. The escape routes being planned. The knowledge being accumulated. The small ember of defiance being carefully protected, fed with oxygen only in the moments when no one was watching.

Rust was nine years old. He'd been imprisoned for seven years. He had no idea how much longer he'd remain here—another year? Five years? Forever?

But he knew this: when opportunity came, he would be ready.

## Reflection: Age 13

*Those years of mapping the monastery saved my life. When I finally escaped at twelve, I didn't fumble or hesitate. I knew exactly where to go, which walls to climb, where the Sisters' blind spots were. The escape itself took maybe three minutes. The preparation took two years.*

*That's what people don't understand about trapped children. We might seem passive, broken, resigned. But sometimes we're just playing the long game. Sometimes obedience is strategy, and patience is preparation.*

*The monastery taught me to plan for the future by making my present so unbearable that future survival became the only logical goal. They wanted to break me. They actually taught me discipline, patience, and strategic thinking. They wanted to make me a servant. They accidentally made me dangerous.*

*Every skill I have now, I built from pieces I salvaged from that place. Even the horror had uses. Even the worst experiences taught me something.*

*I survived by becoming someone they underestimated. And then I used their underestimation as a weapon.*
