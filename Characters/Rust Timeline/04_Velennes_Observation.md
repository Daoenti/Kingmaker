# Velenne's Observation: Ages 6-8

*Content Warning: This narrative deals with systematic physical abuse of a child, deliberate experimentation with pain and injury, and the psychological manipulation of someone too young to understand or resist. This chapter documents the beginning of targeted torture disguised as "discipline."*

## The Watcher

[[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] had always been at the monastery. She was a fixture, like the stone walls or the dawn bell—permanent, immovable, inevitable.

But for [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s first five years, she'd been peripheral. One Sister among many. A presence in morning prayers, a shadow in hallways, a voice occasionally delivering punishment. Not special. Not particularly noteworthy.

That changed shortly after his sixth birthday.

It started with watching.

He'd be scrubbing floors, and she'd be there at the end of the hall. Standing. Observing. Not doing anything, just... present.

He'd be in lessons, struggling through a theological text, and he'd feel eyes on him. He'd look up, and there she'd be in the doorway. Watching.

He'd be hauling water from the well, and she'd be at the window above. Watching.

At first, he thought it was coincidence. The monastery wasn't large; you saw the same Sisters repeatedly. But this was different. Deliberate. Persistent.

Sister Velenne was watching him specifically. And when [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] was six years old, just beginning to understand patterns, just starting to develop the hypervigilance that would define his survival—he knew with cold certainty that being watched was dangerous.

## The First Deliberate Test (Age 6)

The observation period lasted several weeks. Then came the first test.

It happened during morning work. Rust was hauling laundry to the washing room—heavy baskets of linens that required multiple trips. He was working quickly, efficiently, trying to finish before the midday bell.

Sister Velenne appeared in the corridor.

"Stop," she said.

He stopped immediately. Put down the basket. Stood at attention. Waited for whatever infraction he'd committed to be named and punished.

"You're working too quickly," she said. "Haste leads to carelessness. You'll redo this task properly."

Rust's mind raced. He'd been working carefully. The linens were handled correctly, folded as taught, transported without damage. There was no actual error.

But there was no point in arguing. "Yes, Sister," he said.

He hauled the laundry back to where he'd started. Began again. Worked even more carefully this time, deliberately slow to show proper attention to detail.

He'd made it halfway through when Sister Velenne reappeared.

"Now you're working too slowly," she said. "Sloth is a sin. The work must be completed before the bell."

The bell would ring in less time than the task required. It was impossible.

"Yes, Sister," he said anyway.

He worked faster. Finished with perhaps thirty seconds before the bell rang. Exhausted, sweating, he'd pushed his six-year-old body to its absolute limit.

Sister Velenne examined his work with methodical precision. Found a single linen folded with a corner slightly askew—something he'd missed in his desperate hurry.

"Unacceptable," she said.

The beating that followed was routine by monastery standards. Rod across shoulders and back, measured blows that hurt tremendously but caused no visible lasting damage. He'd been beaten before. This was nothing new.

What was new was what happened after.

Sister Velenne made him stand while she inspected the injuries. Lifted his shirt. Examined the welts rising across his shoulders. Took out a small journal and made notes.

"Dismissed," she finally said.

He fled. Returned to work. Tried not to think about the way she'd studied his injuries like a scholar studies texts.

But that night, lying in his cold bed, he understood: that hadn't been punishment for poor work.

That had been something else. A test, an experiment, an observation with purposes he didn't understand.

Sister Velenne wasn't punishing him for infractions.

She was studying what happened when she hurt him.

## The Pattern Emerges (Age 6)

Over the following months, a pattern developed.

Sister Velenne would create impossible situations. Tasks that couldn't be completed. Standards that contradicted each other. Expectations designed to ensure failure.

Then she would punish the inevitable failure.

Then she would observe.

**Example One: The Scripture Copying**

She assigned him to copy a theological text—fifty pages, to be completed in two hours. The timeframe was impossible for an adult scribe, let alone a six-year-old child.

He worked until his hand cramped, until the letters blurred, until tears of frustration threatened to fall. He completed perhaps twenty pages.

She beat him for incomplete work. Then examined his hand, noted the ink stains and blisters, made annotations in her journal.

**Example Two: The Cold Water Task**

Mid-winter, she ordered him to wash windows—outside windows, in freezing rain, without adequate clothing.

He worked until his fingers went numb, until he couldn't feel his hands enough to hold the cloth. Until hypothermia symptoms began to manifest.

She beat him for inadequate work. Then noted his body temperature, his shivering, his recovery time in her journal.

**Example Three: The Fasting "Discipline"**

She denied him meals for three days as punishment for an imagined infraction. At the end of three days, she ordered him to complete heavy physical labor.

He tried. His body, starved and exhausted, couldn't manage. He literally collapsed.

She had him carried to the infirmary. Then visited to observe his recovery. Made detailed notes about how long it took him to regain strength.

At six years old, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] didn't have words for what was happening. He knew it was different from normal monastery discipline. He knew Sister Velenne was doing something beyond standard punishment.

What he didn't know—what he couldn't know—was that she'd noticed something strange.

He recovered faster than he should.

## The Discovery (Age 6-7)

Human children bruised, and the bruises lasted days. Their injuries healed on predictable timelines. A beating severe enough to leave welts would show marks for a week or more.

Rust's injuries faded faster.

Not dramatically faster. Not obviously supernatural. But measurably, documentably faster.

Sister Velenne noticed.

She began tracking recovery times. She beat him with the same force she used on human children and noted that his bruises faded in half the time. She created controlled experiments—identical injuries on comparable body parts, then observation of healing rates.

She documented everything:
- Time from injury to initial inflammation
- Time from inflammation to bruising
- Time from bruising to fading
- Time from fading to complete healing

For the human children, the process was predictable. For Rust, it was accelerated.

At six, he wasn't consciously aware of this. He knew he got hurt frequently, knew the pain was constant, knew that beatings were a fact of his existence.

What he didn't realize was that his body was betraying him. That the very thing that helped him survive—his unusual healing—was making him interesting to Sister Velenne.

And being interesting to Sister Velenne was the most dangerous thing in the world.

## Escalation (Age 7)

As Sister Velenne's observations continued, her experiments intensified.

She moved from creating impossible tasks to deliberately engineering injuries. Not as discipline for failure—that was just the excuse. The real purpose was observation, documentation, understanding of this anomaly in her care.

**The Falling Incident:**

She ordered him to clean high windows. Gave him an unstable ladder. Positioned herself where she could observe when he inevitably fell.

He fell from eight feet. Landed badly. Pain exploded through his shoulder and ribs.

She was there immediately—not to comfort, but to document. She examined the injury site, estimated the damage, noted the time.

Over the next week, she visited daily to observe healing. The shoulder that should have been immobile for weeks was functional within days. The ribs that should have taken a month to knit were healed in two weeks.

She filled pages in her journal. And her eyes, when she looked at him, held something between curiosity and hunger.

**The Burning:**

She caught him reaching for food that had been left unattended—not stealing exactly, but close enough to justify punishment.

She held his hand over a candle flame. Long enough that the smell of burning skin filled the room. Long enough that he bit through his lip trying not to scream.

Then she bandaged it herself. Checked it daily. Documented the progression from burn to blister to scar tissue to complete healing.

A burn that severe should have taken months. His healed in three weeks, leaving no scar.

She wrote page after page of notes.

**The Rod:**

The beatings became more severe. Systematic. Measured.

She would beat him, document the injuries, wait for healing, then beat him again. She varied intensity, location, frequency. She was establishing baselines, testing hypotheses, conducting experiments with his body as the subject.

At seven years old, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] lived in constant low-level pain. His body was always healing from something. His back was a tapestry of bruises in various stages of fading. His ribs learned the specific ache of near-breaks that healed too fast to fully fracture.

And Sister Velenne watched it all. Recorded it all. Studied him like he was a particularly interesting specimen rather than a small child in constant agony.

## The Questions He Couldn't Ask (Age 7)

[[Characters/Rust|Rust]], at seven, began to understand that something was wrong beyond the normal wrongness of monastery life.

Human children who were beaten showed injuries for weeks. He hurt just as much in the moment—maybe more, since Sister Velenne hit him harder—but the visible evidence faded fast.

Human children who got sick stayed sick for predictable durations. When he caught fever or infection, it passed more quickly.

Human children who suffered injuries had recovery times the Sisters could predict. His recovery times made Sister Velenne fill journals.

He started to realize: his body was doing something. Something unusual. Something that made him special in a way that brought only danger.

He had questions he couldn't ask:

Why did he heal faster?

Had he always healed faster, or was this new?

Did other goblins heal like this, or was it specific to him?

Was this why he'd survived when his tribe was destroyed—had his body saved him somehow?

Was this a gift? A curse? Both?

Should he hide it? Could he hide it?

And the most frightening question of all: What would happen when Sister Velenne finished studying him and decided to test his limits?

## The Night in the Discipline Chamber (Age 7)

The discipline chamber was where children were taken for serious punishments. It was in the basement, isolated, soundproofed by thick stone walls. Most children visited it rarely—once or twice a year at most, for genuinely serious infractions.

By age seven, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] had been there dozens of times.

Sister Velenne took him there after catching him in the library past curfew. He'd been reading—not anything forbidden particularly, just reading when he should have been sleeping.

The punishment was disproportionate. Deliberate.

She beat him more severely than ever before. Rod across back, shoulders, ribs. Methodical, measured, counting the blows. Stopping periodically to check his consciousness, his breathing, his pain response.

She documented everything. Between beatings, she made notes. After each set of blows, she assessed the damage.

She was trying to find his breaking point.

At some moment during that night—through the pain and fear and exhaustion—[[Characters/Rust|Rust]] understood something terrible:

Sister Velenne wasn't going to stop. Not tonight, not ever. She would keep testing, keep pushing, keep documenting until she found his absolute limit.

And his limit was higher than normal children. Which meant she would push him further.

His fast healing, the thing that let him survive her experiments, was the exact thing that ensured the experiments would continue.

He couldn't break fast enough to make her stop.

When she finally finished, when he lay curled on the cold stone floor in a puddle of his own blood, she knelt beside him.

"Interesting," she said quietly. "You're still conscious. A human child would have passed out from shock by now."

She helped him to his feet—not kindness, just ensuring he could walk back to the dormitory.

"Tomorrow I want you in the infirmary," she said. "I'll examine your recovery."

He nodded. Stumbled back to his bed. Lay there in darkness and pain and growing understanding.

Sister Velenne had found something interesting in him. And she was going to study it, test it, push it to absolute limits.

And because he healed fast, because his body betrayed him by surviving, those limits were much further away than they should be.

## The Journal (Age 8)

At eight years old, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] saw Sister Velenne's journal.

It was accident and carelessness on her part. She'd left it on a desk in the discipline chamber while fetching something from storage. He was waiting there, having been summoned for what he assumed would be another beating.

The journal was open.

He saw his name. Saw dates. Saw detailed observations written in her precise handwriting.

He began to read:

*"Subject 'Rust' - Day 187 of observation. Today's test involved controlled burn injury to left forearm. Second-degree burns covering approximately three square inches. Subject showed appropriate pain response. Healing commenced within hours—faster than any documented case in medical texts. Complete healing expected within 21 days, versus standard 45-60 day timeline for such injuries in human subjects."*

More entries. Pages and pages of them:

*"Fracture test conducted on right radius. Controlled fall from measured height. Subject exhibits accelerated bone knitting. Recommend follow-up testing once current healing completes."*

*"Subject shows resistance to systemic illness. Fever broke within 36 hours versus expected 72-hour duration. Possible enhanced immune response?"*

*"Pain tolerance appears normal for age, but recovery from pain-induced trauma is measurably faster. Subject returns to baseline psychological state within hours of severe punishment, versus days for comparable human subjects."*

There were hypotheses. Questions. Plans for future experimentation:

*"Next test series: graduated trauma to establish upper limits of regenerative capacity. Begin with moderate injuries and increase severity until normal healing timelines are observed. This will establish subject's maximum healing threshold."*

*"Consider: Is this trait genetic (common to goblinoid species) or unique to this subject? Recommend obtaining additional goblinoid subjects for comparative study if possible."*

*"Theological implications: Does accelerated healing represent divine intervention? Demonic influence? Natural variation? Requires consultation with senior clergy."*

He heard her footsteps returning.

He stepped away from the desk. Stood at attention. Gave no indication he'd read anything.

She retrieved the journal, gave him his expected beating, documented the results, dismissed him.

But everything had changed.

He knew now. Knew what she was doing. Knew the beatings weren't punishment—they were research. Knew he wasn't a student or even a prisoner.

He was a test subject.

And the experiments were only going to get worse.

## The Cost of Understanding (Age 8)

By eight years old, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] had survived two years of Sister Velenne's systematic study. His body bore no scars—they healed too fast for scarring—but his understanding of his situation had fundamentally changed.

**Physical Cost:**

He lived in constant expectation of pain. Not just normal monastery discipline, but deliberate, experimental injury. Sister Velenne wasn't interested in correcting behavior—she was interested in data.

His body had learned to exist in a permanent state of partial healing. There was always something recovering. Always some new injury layered over old. Always pain somewhere, measured and documented in Sister Velenne's journal.

**Psychological Cost:**

The unpredictability was almost worse than the pain. With normal discipline, you could avoid punishment by following rules. But Sister Velenne's experiments required him to be injured. She would manufacture infractions, create impossible standards, invent reasons to hurt him.

He couldn't prevent it by good behavior. He couldn't escape it by obedience. His only path to safety was to be completely ordinary—and his body's unusual healing made that impossible.

**Knowledge Cost:**

He knew what she was doing. Knew he was being studied. Knew that his fast healing, which should have been an advantage, was instead making him a permanent target.

And he knew she would keep pushing. Keep testing. Keep trying to find his breaking point. Because that's what researchers do—they establish limits, define boundaries, push subjects to extremes.

He was eight years old, and he understood that Sister Velenne would eventually try to kill him. Not intentionally, not maliciously—just as the inevitable conclusion of experiments designed to find his maximum capacity for healing.

She would push him right up to that edge. And maybe over it, if she miscalculated.

## The Unintended Consequence

Sister Velenne intended her experiments to gather data, to understand this unusual healing capacity, to document something potentially theologically significant.

What she didn't anticipate was that her systematic abuse was training [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] in ways she never intended.

**He learned pattern recognition:**

Every experiment had structure. She created situations, observed results, documented findings. By watching her patterns, he began to anticipate what was coming. This didn't let him avoid the pain, but it gave him fractional moments to prepare mentally.

**He learned his own capacity:**

Through forced experience, he learned exactly how much damage his body could take and heal from. Learned which injuries were serious versus which were painful but temporary. Learned his recovery timelines, his pain thresholds, his physical limits.

This knowledge would save his life later, in the discipline chamber during his awakening.

**He learned endurance beyond normal human capacity:**

Because he healed fast, Sister Velenne pushed him harder and more frequently than human children. This built endurance, pain tolerance, resilience. Not strength exactly—he was still a small, underfed goblin child—but the ability to continue functioning through suffering that would incapacitate others.

**He learned observation:**

Watching Sister Velenne document him taught him to observe and record. To notice details, remember patterns, track changes over time. These analytical skills, learned in the worst possible way, would later help him survive on his own.

**He learned that adults could be wrong:**

Sister Velenne claimed her actions were discipline, education, necessary study. But [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] could read her journal. He knew the truth. Adults could lie, could justify cruelty, could convince themselves that systematic abuse was actually something noble.

This lesson—that authority could be completely, fundamentally wrong—was perhaps the most important thing he learned.

Sister Velenne was creating the perfect subject for her experiments.

She was also, accidentally, creating someone who would survive her.

## The Goblin in the Mirror (Age 8)

One day, while cleaning Sister Velenne's study, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] saw himself in a mirror.

The monastery had few mirrors—vanity was discouraged. But Sister Velenne had one in her quarters, and he caught his reflection while dusting.

He stopped. Looked at himself.

A small goblin child, rust-colored skin, eyes too old for his age. Thin from inadequate food. Shoulders slightly hunched from expecting blows. Face that had learned stillness, learned to show no reaction even when every part of him wanted to scream.

He looked like someone being systematically broken.

But he wasn't broken. Not yet. Not completely.

Sister Velenne had been experimenting on him for two years. Had hurt him in dozens of ways, documented his healing, pushed him to limits that should have shattered him.

And he was still here. Still standing. Still him, despite everything.

His body healed fast. That was the curse that made him interesting to her.

But his mind was intact. That was the gift that might let him survive her.

He turned away from the mirror. Finished his cleaning. Returned to work.

But the image stayed with him: a small goblin child who'd survived two years of systematic abuse and wasn't broken yet.

Sister Velenne saw him as a research subject. As a mystery to be solved, limits to be discovered, hypotheses to be tested.

She didn't see what was actually developing in response to her experiments: a child learning to endure impossible suffering. Learning to observe and analyze. Learning that his body could survive almost anything.

Learning, though he didn't know it yet, that he was harder to kill than anyone expected.

Including himself.

## What Was Coming (Age 8)

At eight years old, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] didn't know about the awakening that would come four years later. Didn't know that Sister Velenne's experiments were preparing him, building tolerance, teaching his body to survive trauma that should be fatal.

He just knew that the experiments continued. That Sister Velenne's journal grew thicker. That his understanding of his own suffering grew more precise and more horrifying.

He knew that human children's bodies gave out. Reached limits. Broke and stayed broken.

His didn't. His healed. And that healing meant Sister Velenne would keep testing, keep pushing, keep documenting.

He was eight years old. He had four more years of this ahead of him. Four more years of Sister Velenne's observation, experimentation, systematic abuse.

And somewhere deep inside, in a place she couldn't reach with her rod or her journal or her methodical cruelty, a small hard core of him refused to break.

Not defiance exactly—he was too young, too powerless for defiance.

Just... persistence. Endurance. The stubborn refusal to let her experiments erase who he was.

Sister Velenne was documenting how much damage a fast-healing goblin child could survive.

What she wasn't documenting, what her journal would never capture, was this: she was creating someone who knew exactly how much he could endure.

And that knowledge, when combined with fast healing and desperate need to survive, would eventually become something the monastery never anticipated.

It would become escape.

But that was four years away. Four more years of discipline chambers and documented injuries and Sister Velenne's precise, methodical, systematic cruelty.

Four more years of learning to survive the unsurvivable.

Four more years of becoming someone harder to break than anyone imagined.

*"She kept a journal. Documented every beating, every injury, every recovery time. Filled pages with observations about how fast I healed. I saw it once—saw myself described as 'Subject Rust,' saw my suffering reduced to data points and hypotheses. She was trying to figure out my limits. What she didn't realize was that her experiments were teaching me those limits too. She was teaching me exactly how much I could survive. That knowledge saved my life the night I awakened. She created the conditions for her own failure and documented the whole process."* - Rust, age 13
