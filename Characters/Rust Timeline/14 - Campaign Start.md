# Campaign Start

**Age:** 13 (present day)  
**Location:** [To be determined by campaign]  
**Key Theme:** Ready to begin

---

Thirteen years old. One year and three months since the awakening. Five seasons since walking out of Sevenarches. Hundreds of miles traveled, dozens of towns passed through, more jobs than he could count.

Rust stood at a crossroads—literally and metaphorically—trying to decide which direction to walk.

Behind him lay the accumulated weight of his past. The monastery that shaped him through cruelty. The awakening that freed him. Sevenarches that gave him time to heal. The wandering year that taught him survival. All of it brought him here, to this moment, to the start of whatever came next.

Ahead lay... everything else. The world in all its complexity and possibility. Adventure, danger, opportunity, risk. A chance to be more than a survivor. A chance to find out who he could become when he wasn't just running from his past.

He'd survived things that should have killed him. He'd learned things the monastery never meant to teach him. He'd discovered magic they said he couldn't have and freedom they said he didn't deserve. He'd walked away from everything meant to define him and spent a year proving he could exist without their structure.

Now came the hard part: figuring out what to build with that freedom.

## Who Rust Is

A thirteen-year-old goblin with mismatched eyes and more scars than someone his age should have. He moves quickly and talks carefully, always calculating exit routes and watching for threats. He's clever, resourceful, and deeply cynical about authority figures.

He knows four languages but prefers Goblin for private thoughts. He reads voraciously when he has access to books. He's learning to fight with knives but hopes he never has to use them. He can light fires with a thought and knows the exact number of steps it takes to reach the nearest door in any room he enters.

He doesn't know what he wants to be, but he knows what he refuses to become: anyone's victim, anyone's project, anyone's definition but his own.

He's spent a year learning to survive. Now he's ready to learn to live.

## Campaign Hook Possibilities

Rust's background offers multiple entry points for adventure:

**The Seeker Path:** Following the mystery of the elven gates in Sevenarches, drawn to ancient magic and forgotten places.

**The Justice Path:** Working against institutional cruelty, particularly as it affects children and the powerless.

**The Wanderer Path:** Continuing to explore the world, taking jobs and solving problems as a way to understand humanity (and his place in it).

**The Knowledge Path:** Pursuing education and understanding, seeking out libraries, teachers, and ancient texts.

**The Revenge Path:** Eventually confronting the monastery or Sister Velenne (though Rust isn't sure he wants this).

**The Community Path:** Finding or building a place where people like him—the broken, the outcast, the survivors—can exist safely.

## Current Situation

Rust has been in [location] for [time period], working as [job] and staying at [accommodation]. He has approximately [small amount] of coin, the clothes on his back, a decent knife, and a worn pack containing his few possessions.

He's heard rumors about [adventure hook], which [sounds interesting/concerning/relevant to his interests]. He's considering whether to investigate or keep moving like he's done for the past year.

What he decides will depend on the specifics of the situation and who else might be involved. But for the first time since his awakening, Rust is making choices rather than just reacting to circumstances.

That feels like progress.

## What Rust Wants

This is the question Rust himself can't quite answer yet.

He wants to be safe, but he's learning that total safety is impossible. He wants to understand why the monastery treated him the way they did, but he's afraid the answer won't matter. He wants to find others like him—survivors, outcasts, people who don't fit into neat categories—but he doesn't know how to be part of a community after so long alone.

Most of all, he wants to prove that survival wasn't just luck. That he can not only endure but thrive. That the child who broke free from the monastery's cage can become someone who matters, someone with purpose, someone who helps rather than just takes up space.

He's got a long way to go. But he's got time. He's got freedom. He's got a sharp mind, quick hands, and the kind of stubbornness that only comes from refusing to die when everyone expected you to.

The rest, he figures, he'll learn along the way.

## Present Day

The crossroads stretched in four directions. North toward the River Kingdoms and the chaos he'd come to understand. South toward Cheliax and the structured cruelty he'd escaped. East toward Kyonin and the strange safety of Sevenarches. West toward... well, he wasn't sure. New places. New possibilities.

Rust adjusted his pack, checked that his knife was secure, and took a breath of spring air that tasted like rain and new growth.

Thirteen years old. Still alive. Still free. Still figuring out what came next.

But for the first time, he was looking forward instead of backward. The monastery had taught him to survive through pain. Sevenarches had taught him to survive through patience. The wandering year had taught him to survive through adaptation.

Now it was time to learn what came after survival.

Time to learn to live.

Rust chose a direction and started walking.

## Final Reflection

*"So here I am. Thirteen years old, standing at another crossroads trying to decide which way to walk. The difference is that this time, I get to choose.*

*I spent ten years in a place that told me exactly who I was—worthless, broken, abomination, mistake. Then I spent a year learning they were wrong. Now I'm starting the part where I figure out who I actually am when nobody else is defining me.*

*I don't have the answers yet. Don't know what I want to be or where I'm going or what I'm looking for. But I know what tools I'm bringing: three languages, basic magic, survival skills, too many books' worth of knowledge, and the absolute certainty that I'd rather die free than live in any cage, no matter how comfortable.*

*The Sisters taught me to endure. Sevenarches taught me to exist. The wandering year taught me to function. Now comes the hard part—learning to actually live.*

*I'm ready. I think. As ready as anyone is when they're starting from nothing with no map and no guarantee they'll make it.*

*But I've survived worse odds before.*

*Let's see what comes next."*

**The Story Begins Here**

This timeline documents everything that brought Rust to this moment. The abuse, the awakening, the escape, the recovery, the learning. All of it is foundation—but not destiny.

What happens next is unwritten. That's the point.

He's ready for the adventure to begin.
