# The Weight of Words: Age 7

*Content Warning: This narrative deals with forced cultural assimilation, linguistic oppression, and the weaponization of language as a tool of control.*

---

## The Language of Hell

At seven years old, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] learned that words could burn.

Not metaphorically—though that was also true. Literally. When [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] began teaching him Infernal, the language of devils, the words felt wrong in his mouth. Harsh. Angular. Like swallowing broken glass.

"Again," she commanded, standing over him in the dim scriptorium where she conducted his "special lessons." The other children were at evening prayers, but Rust had been pulled aside. Always pulled aside now, since the literacy test.

"*Asmodeus vincit omnia,*" he repeated, the Infernal phrase twisting his tongue. *Asmodeus conquers all.*

"Better. But your accent betrays you, goblin. You pronounce it like a slave learning his master's language, not like one born to it." She smiled, thin and cold. "Which is, of course, exactly what you are."

The lessons continued three times per week. Infernal grammar. Infernal conjugations. The nine hierarchies of Hell and how to address each properly. Contracts and clauses and the precise legal language of damnation.

"Why must I learn this?" he'd dared to ask once, early on.

Sister Velenne's hand had been swift. "Because language is power, and power must serve order. Infernal is the language of perfect hierarchy, of law made manifest, of every being knowing its place. It is Asmodeus's greatest gift to civilization—a tongue that makes rebellion grammatically impossible."

She wasn't entirely wrong about that last part. Infernal had no word for "freedom" that didn't also mean "chaos" or "damnation." It had seventeen different words for "obedience," each with subtle gradations of enthusiasm and completeness. The language itself was a prison.

## The Language of Blood

Sister Velenne taught him Infernal because it served the monastery's ideology. But she also taught him Goblin, and her reasons for that were more complex.

"You'll need to read the historical accounts," she explained during their first Goblin lesson. "The chronicles of the [[Events/Goblinblood Wars|Goblinblood Wars]]. Primary sources. Goblin military reports, tribal records, confessions extracted from prisoners."

She placed a leather-bound book before him. The cover was stamped with the symbol of [[Locations/Isger|Isger]]—a sunburst over crossed swords.

"This is *The Cleansing of Isger: A Complete Account*. It documents the systematic elimination of the goblin threat from civilized lands. You will translate selected passages. Consider it your people's history lesson."

The pages were full of death. Casualty reports written with cold efficiency. Lists of tribes eradicated. Maps showing the progressive "clearing" of goblin territories. And yes, some passages in Goblin—captured documents, translated tribal songs, the last words of chieftains before execution.

Learning Goblin through genocide records was psychological warfare, and Sister Velenne knew it. Every vocabulary word came attached to violence:

- *Ghev* (tribe) - as in "Ghev Bloodsnout eliminated, 247 confirmed dead"
- *Zod* (home) - as in "all zods burned, none left standing"  
- *Zuul* (child) - as in "no zuuls spared, strategic elimination of breeding population"

But language has a strange power that even Sister Velenne couldn't fully control. As Rust learned Goblin vocabulary, something deeper stirred. Sometimes a word would feel familiar before he'd read the definition. Sometimes the grammar made sense in a way that bypassed conscious thought, as if some part of him remembered.

*Did my mother speak these words to me?* he wondered, tracing the angular goblin script. *Did she call me zuul?*

He would never know. But learning Goblin, even through records of atrocity, gave him something the Sisters couldn't take away: a connection to what he'd lost. Every word was an act of reclamation, a refusal to let his people be reduced to the monastery's narrative of savagery and righteous extermination.

## Three Tongues, Three Identities

By the end of age seven, Rust was trilingual:

**Common** was the language of daily survival. The tongue he spoke to other orphans, the language of "yes, Sister" and "I understand" and "please, no more." Common was where he existed, not quite human but forced to pretend proximity to humanity.

**Infernal** was the language of his oppression. Every prayer in chapel, every legal document, every statement of monastery policy—written in the tongue of Hell and justified by its grammar. When the Sisters spoke Infernal, they revealed what they truly were: servants of tyranny who'd made hierarchy into holiness.

**Goblin** was the language of his stolen past. He couldn't speak it aloud—there was no one to speak it to, and using it would invite punishment. But in his private thoughts, sometimes words emerged in Goblin: *ghev* for the family he'd never known, *zod* for a home he couldn't remember, *zuul* for the child he'd been before they renamed him Rust.

Three languages. Three ways of seeing the world. Three identities he had to navigate daily.

## The Politics of Code-Switching

Rust learned early that choosing which language to speak was never neutral.

When a Sister addressed him in Common, responding in Common meant acknowledging their authority over him. Responding in Infernal meant accepting their worldview, their hierarchy, their version of divine order.

He had no choice but to respond as expected. But he could think in Goblin. He could read their Infernal prayers and know them for propaganda. He could use Common while mentally translating it into something closer to truth.

"Subject Rust demonstrates exceptional linguistic aptitude," Sister Velenne wrote in her journal. "Fluent in three languages by age seven. The specimen continues to exceed expectations. Further testing warranted."

She thought she was documenting his utility. She didn't realize she was documenting his resistance.

Every language he learned gave him tools to see through the monastery's lies. Infernal taught him how tyranny justified itself. Goblin gave him connection to who he'd been before they broke him. Common was the mask he wore to survive.

And survival, he was beginning to understand, was its own form of rebellion.

## Words as Weapons

Near the end of his seventh year, something shifted in how Rust thought about language.

He was translating a passage from the Goblinblood Wars—a report about a goblin tribe that had sued for peace before being massacred anyway. The Infernal translation called it "necessary security measures." The original Goblin called it *ghev-zuul-murzon*: "the murder of families and children."

The same event. Two completely different realities.

That's when Rust understood: words weren't just communication. They were weapons. Tools of power. Ways to shape reality itself.

The Sisters used language to maintain control—to make children believe they deserved punishment, to make abuse sound like education, to make a prison sound like salvation.

But if language could be used as a weapon against him, then maybe—someday—he could learn to wield it as a weapon too.

Not yet. He was seven, and still far too powerless. But someday.

He filed that understanding away, deep in the part of his mind the Sisters couldn't reach. Where he kept every truth they tried to hide, every skill they accidentally taught him, every piece of knowledge that might help him survive.

*Words are power,* he thought, carefully turning another page of genocide records. *And they don't realize they're teaching me to use them.*

## Reflection: Age 13

*Looking back now, the language lessons were some of Sister Velenne's biggest mistakes. She wanted to show me how inferior my people were, how righteous the slaughter had been. Instead, she taught me how oppressors think, how they justify atrocity, how they use words to make horror seem necessary.*

*I speak three languages fluently now. Infernal reminds me what I'm fighting against. Goblin reminds me what was stolen. Common is how I navigate a world that will never fully accept me.*

*Sister Velenne thought linguistic skill would make me a better servant. She was half right—it made me better at something. Just not at serving.*

*Every word I learned was a tool. And Tools can be used in ways their makers never intended.*
