## The Bad Map

Six months after his escape from the [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|monastery]], twelve-year-old [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] made what he'd later call the worst decision of his young life.

He'd been moving steadily north, taking odd jobs when he could find them, sleeping rough when he couldn't. In a small trading post, a merchant had gotten too curious about how a lone goblin child had survived a wagon accident that crushed two draft horses. Questions about his healing were dangerous questions.

So Rust ran again, like he always did.

His map—bought from a traveling trader for three copper pieces—showed [[Locations/Sevenarches|Sevenarches]] as a simple forest settlement. A straight path through from the River Kingdoms to Kyonin. The merchant had marked it as a shortcut, a way to save two weeks of travel.

The map was catastrophically wrong.

## Thornwatch

At Thornwatch, the last settlement before the forest, Rust stopped at an inn for supplies. The innkeeper—Keseth, a weathered half-elf with scars on his hands—took one look at Rust's intended route and shook his head.

"You're not going through Sevenarches."

Rust, twelve years old and confident in his newfound unbreakability, shrugged. "It's just a forest."

"No," Keseth said flatly. "It's not. People who go into those woods don't come out the same. If they come out at all."

"I'll be fine."

"Kid, I've seen adventurers—*real* adventurers with magic and steel and experience—go in there. The ones who came back..." He trailed off, staring at something Rust couldn't see. "They weren't right. One kept talking to people who weren't there. Another forgot her own name. A third just... stood at the tree line for three days, staring, until someone dragged her away."

Rust thought about the monastery, about Sister Velenne's worst beatings, about lying on cold stone waiting to die. He'd survived that. He'd survived months alone as a twelve-year-old with nothing. He could survive a forest.

"I've been through worse," he said, which was probably true.

Keseth looked at him for a long moment. "No," he said quietly. "You haven't. Nobody has."

But Rust was already leaving, pack on his shoulders, map in hand.

Behind him, he heard Keseth mutter: "Stubborn little fool."

Rust couldn't argue with that assessment.

## The Wrong Forest

The wrongness started before he even reached the tree line.

Birds stopped singing. The wind, which had been steady all morning, died to nothing. The air felt thick, resistant, like pushing through water.

The trees at the forest's edge were old—not old like ancient oaks, but old in a way that made his skin crawl. They looked like they'd been standing there since before time had rules.

Rust stood at the boundary, every instinct screaming at him to turn around.

But the merchant was two days behind him, asking questions. Going around would take weeks. And he was unbreakable, wasn't he? His curse would keep him alive.

*The curse doesn't stop pain,* something whispered in the back of his mind. *Just death.*

He stepped into Sevenarches anyway.

## The Circles

About a mile in, Rust noticed the pattern.

The trees grew in perfect circles around cleared spaces. Not natural clearings—*perfect* geometric circles, as if someone had measured them with instruments. In the center of each clearing stood a single weathered stone, carved with symbols that hurt to look at directly.

When he tried to focus on the symbols, they seemed to shift. Move. Rearrange themselves into patterns that didn't make sense but somehow meant something his mind couldn't process.

He felt like he was looking at words in a language he'd never learned but somehow almost understood.

The path between circles felt guided. Every time he tried to deviate, to go a different direction, the trees were too thick, the undergrowth too tangled. But the way forward was always clear.

The forest was herding him.

*I should go back,* Rust thought.

But when he turned around, the path behind him looked different. Wrong. Like it led somewhere other than where he'd come from.

He was twelve years old, alone, and rapidly realizing Keseth had been right.

## The Silence

By what felt like midday—though the sun was impossible to see through the canopy—absolute silence fell.

No wind. No insects. No birds. No rustling leaves or creaking branches.

Just silence so complete that Rust could hear his own heartbeat pounding in his ears.

Then the whispers started.

Not sounds exactly—his ears registered nothing. But the *idea* of voices, resonating directly in his skull. Whispers that bypassed his senses and spoke to something deeper.

The stones were talking.

And they knew he was there.

## The Recognition

Something noticed him.

Rust felt it like a physical weight—attention from something vast beyond comprehension. Not hostile, but *curious*. The way a scholar might examine an interesting specimen. The way Sister Velenne had looked at him when his bruises healed too fast.

His curse responded without his permission.

The power inside him—the thing that kept him alive, that healed injuries that should kill him—reached back toward whatever had noticed him. Like recognizing like. Impossibility calling to impossibility.

For one horrifying moment, twelve-year-old Rust's consciousness expanded to touch something impossibly ancient and utterly alien.

## What He Saw

**Time wasn't working right.**

He saw the forest as it was, as it had been, as it would be—all at once. Trees growing backward, unseeding themselves. Creatures flickering in and out of existence. The clearing he stood in was simultaneously empty, occupied by elk, and buried under snow that hadn't fallen yet.

**The clearings were doors.**

Not metaphorically. Actually, literally doors. Thresholds to elsewhere. To elsewhen. Things moved through them—entities that wore shapes the way Rust wore clothes. Uncomfortable. Ill-fitting. Wrong.

**His curse recognized this place.**

Whatever sustained him, whatever kept him alive when he should die, was related to what dwelled in Sevenarches. Not the same, but cousins. Both built on impossibility. Both predating the rules that governed normal reality.

The revelation came with terrible certainty: if he went deeper, the forest could teach him.

Show him the true nature of what he carried. Make him *understand*.

But understanding would change him. The twelve-year-old boy who'd escaped the monastery would be remade into something else. Something that understood things mortal minds weren't built to know.

There would be nothing left of Rust. Just something that used to be a goblin child.

## The Offer

No words were exchanged. But Rust understood anyway, in the same way he understood his own heartbeat.

**Knowledge:** Complete understanding of his curse's nature and origin

**Control:** True mastery over his unbreakable regeneration

**Power:** Access to primordial forces that existed before the gods

**Price:** His identity—everything that made him *him*

The forest wasn't threatening. It was simply waiting, patient as stone, for him to choose.

It would wait forever if necessary. Time meant nothing here.

## The Terror

In that moment of expanded consciousness, Rust felt what accepting would mean.

He'd stop being a child. Stop being himself. Become something that couldn't fit back into normal reality. Lose everything he was trying to become.

He'd spent his whole short life having his identity chosen for him:

- The Sisters chose his name, his worth, his purpose
- His curse chose his survival
- He'd only been free for six months

The forest was offering knowledge, but accepting would be surrendering the tiny bit of self he'd managed to claim.

For six months, he'd been learning who *he* was when no one was hurting him. Learning what *he* liked, what *he* wanted, what *he* thought about things.

And the forest wanted to take that away. Not maliciously—just as a necessary cost of understanding.

## The Flight

Rust ran.

Pure childhood panic, not strategic retreat. Primal terror overriding every thought except *GET AWAY GET AWAY GET AWAY*.

He crashed through underbrush, thorns tearing his clothes and skin. Branches whipped his face. Roots tried to trip him. He ignored injury and pain, ignored bleeding cuts, ignored his screaming lungs.

Behind him, the forest's attention followed—not pursuing, but *observing*. Testing whether a child's curiosity would override survival instinct.

It didn't.

Rust ran until his twelve-year-old legs gave out. Until he literally couldn't take another step. Until he collapsed face-first into leaf litter, sobbing and gasping and terrified beyond words.

## The Impossible Return

When he finally lifted his head, still shaking, he found himself at the exact spot where he'd entered the forest.

Impossible.

He'd run for what felt like hours. Deep into Sevenarches, past dozens of stone circles, through impossible spaces where time didn't work.

But here he was, at the forest's edge, at the exact tree he'd passed first.

The forest had released him.

Or perhaps decided a twelve-year-old wasn't ready yet.

## The Long Way Around

Rust didn't stop to question his impossible fortune.

He staggered back toward Thornwatch, half-blind with tears and terror, expecting any moment to find himself back among the stone circles. But the path stayed normal. The forest stayed behind him. The world made sense again.

Keseth took one look at him stumbling into the inn—clothes torn, bleeding from a dozen scratches, eyes wild—and poured him water without a word.

"I was wrong," Rust managed between gasps. "You were right. I'm sorry."

"You're not the first," Keseth said quietly. "Won't be the last."

"What... what *is* that place?"

"Older than gods, they say. Older than the world remembering how to work right." Keseth shook his head. "You going around?"

"Yes."

"Good."

The journey around Sevenarches' borders took an extra three weeks. Rust stayed far enough from the tree line that he couldn't see the forest, let alone feel it. Some nights he woke certain he was back among the circles, stones whispering in his skull.

But he wasn't. The forest had let him go.

For now.

## The Nightmares

That first night after escaping Sevenarches, Rust dreamed.

Doors opening in dark places. Symbols burning into his mind. A voice that wasn't quite a voice, resonating in spaces that shouldn't exist:

*"When you're ready. When you understand what you are. Come back."*

The nightmares continued for months. Still do occasionally, even now at thirteen. Sometimes he wakes certain the forest is calling. That if he walks far enough in any direction, he'll find himself standing before those stone circles again.

The forest remembers him.

And it's patient.

## What He Learned

In the weeks after Sevenarches, as Rust continued his wandering, certain truths settled into his understanding:

**First:** His curse is primordial, not divine. Whatever keeps him alive is older and stranger than any god's magic. It operates on rules that predate the current world.

**Second:** There are worse things than being unbreakable without knowing why. Understanding might cost him everything that makes him himself.

**Third:** Running isn't cowardice when the alternative is losing who you are. Sometimes running is the only way to stay yourself.

**Fourth:** The Sisters' doctrine was even more wrong than he thought. They taught that suffering had meaning, that magic came from divine approval, that everything had its ordered place. But Sevenarches proved there are forces that laugh at that neat little hierarchy. Forces that existed before gods, before order, before meaning itself.

**Fifth:** He's still just twelve. Still a child, no matter how much he's survived. And whatever waited in that forest knew it. Waited for him to be "ready." He doesn't want to know what "ready" means.

## The Price of Refusing

Rust paid a cost for refusing the forest's offer:

He'll never fully understand his curse. Never have complete control over the power that sustains him. Never know exactly what noticed him in the monastery or why it chose to preserve him.

He'll remain incomplete. Broken in ways he can't fix because fixing them requires knowledge he refuses to seek.

But he'll remain *himself*.

After ten years of the Sisters trying to break him into their shape, after months of running and hiding and surviving, being himself matters more than being powerful. More than being knowledgeable. More than being unbreakable.

The forest offered him understanding at the cost of identity.

Twelve-year-old Rust chose identity.

He still thinks he made the right choice.

Most days.

## Reflection at Thirteen (Present Day)

*I was twelve when I walked into Sevenarches. Confident, stupid, convinced my curse would keep me safe. Thought I'd been through the worst things possible at the monastery.*

*I was wrong.*

*The Sisters hurt me, but they couldn't make me not-me. The forest could have. Would have. It showed me what I am underneath\u2014something old and impossible and utterly alien. And it offered to teach me everything about it.*

*All I had to do was stop being Rust.*

*I ran. Pure panic. Childhood terror. I ran until I couldn't run anymore, and somehow—impossibly—I ended up back where I started. The forest let me go.*

*Or maybe it just decided I wasn't ready yet.*

*I still dream about it sometimes. Those stone circles. Those symbols that almost-mean something. That voice that isn't a voice, patient and eternal, waiting for me to come back.*

*"When you're ready."*

*I'm thirteen now. One year older. One year more desperate for answers about this curse I carry. And some nights I wonder if refusing was courage or cowardice.*

*But then I remember: the Sisters tried to break me. The forest tried to remake me. I've spent my whole life having my identity chosen for me.*

*For once—just once—I chose for myself.*

*I chose to stay Rust. Ignorant, incomplete, uncontrolled Rust. But *me*.*

*The forest is still waiting. Still patient. Time means nothing to something eternal.*

*Maybe someday I'll be desperate enough to go back. Maybe someday I'll need those answers more than I need to stay myself.*

*But not today.*

*Not yet.*
