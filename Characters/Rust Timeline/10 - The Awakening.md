# The Night Everything Changed: Age 12

*Content Warning: This narrative contains graphic violence, near-death experience, traumatic power manifestation, and the moment when survival required becoming something other than human. This is the pivot point of Rust's entire story.*

## The Final Session

[[Characters/Rust|Rust]] was twelve years old the night he died and came back different.

It started like dozens of sessions before it. [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] came for him after evening prayers, her face wearing that clinical mask of scientific curiosity that meant pain was coming. He followed without resistance—resistance only made things worse—down the familiar corridors to her private study.

Ten years. He'd been in this place for ten years. Born in fire and blood during the [[Events/Goblinblood Wars|Goblinblood Wars]], captured at age two, imprisoned ever since. Ten years of systematic abuse disguised as education. Ten years of Velenne's experiments. Ten years of learning to survive by becoming smaller, quieter, less visible.

But tonight was different. He could feel it in the way Velenne moved—purposeful, almost excited. In the way she'd prepared her study—more instruments laid out than usual, more restraints, more documentation materials.

"Subject Rust," she said, not looking at him as she organized her tools. "Tonight we push beyond previous parameters. I need to understand the absolute limits of your regenerative capacity before you age out of my research window. You're entering adolescence. The opportunity to study childhood resilience is ending."

He said nothing. There was nothing to say. She'd made similar statements before each escalation.

"I want you to know," she continued, almost conversational, "that your contribution to our understanding of biological anomalies has been invaluable. Whatever happens tonight, your suffering has served a higher purpose."

*My suffering has served your curiosity,* he thought but didn't say. *That's not purpose. That's just cruelty with documentation.*

She gestured to the examination table. "Lie down. This will be extensive."

He obeyed. He always obeyed. Survival meant compliance. Resistance was inefficient.

But something was different tonight. As Velenne secured the restraints—leather straps across his chest, arms, legs—Rust felt a strange detachment. As if he was watching himself from outside his body. As if the part of him that cared about survival had finally, quietly, given up.

*I can't do this anymore,* he realized with perfect clarity. *Not tonight. Not one more session. I'm done.*

It wasn't surrender. It was something else. A kind of peace. An acceptance that breaking was inevitable, and maybe breaking was okay. Maybe there were things worse than death—like endless survival without living.

Velenne didn't notice his internal shift. She was focused on her instruments, muttering notes to herself about baseline measurements and experimental protocols.

Then she began.

## The Breaking

The details don't matter. Rust doesn't remember most of them anyway—his mind has mercifully blurred the specifics into an impressionistic nightmare of sensation without clear narrative.

What he remembers:

**Pain.** Beyond anything before. Velenne had decided to test compound trauma—multiple types of injury simultaneously, overwhelming his healing capacity to see what happened when his body couldn't keep up with the damage.

**Duration.** Hours. Not the usual session of ninety minutes or two hours. This went on and on, Velenne documenting every response, pushing further each time his healing began to catch up.

**The moment he broke.** Not his body—that kept healing, kept functioning, kept performing its uncanny regeneration. His mind. His sense of self. The core of identity that he'd protected through ten years of systematic torture.

It shattered.

Not dramatically. Not with resistance or final defiance. It just... stopped. Like a candle going out. One moment Rust was there—damaged, traumatized, but fundamentally himself. The next moment, he wasn't.

Subject Rust. The specimen. It. The thing on the table. Not a person anymore. Just meat that regenerated.

Sister Velenne had finally achieved what she'd been working toward for six years: complete dehumanization. Total object status. The transformation of person into experimental data.

She didn't recognize her success immediately. She was too focused on documentation, on the fascinating way his body struggled to repair simultaneous catastrophic injuries.

She didn't notice that the light had gone out of his eyes. That he'd stopped tracking her movements. That his breathing had changed to something mechanical, autonomic, divorced from consciousness.

She didn't realize she'd killed him.

Not his body. His self.

And in the space where Rust had been, something else noticed the emptiness.

## Something Vast Reaches Out

Rust doesn't remember this part clearly. Memory fails in moments of transformation. But he remembers fragments:

**Darkness.** Not the darkness of unconsciousness. Something deeper. Older. A darkness that existed before light was invented. Primordial darkness. The darkness between stars, between atoms, between moments of time.

**Presence.** Something vast. Something ancient. Something that existed outside the categories of god or demon or spirit. Something older than theology, older than morality, older than the distinction between life and death.

**Recognition.** It saw him. Or he saw it. Or they saw each other. The direction of perception wasn't clear. But there was recognition—mutual, profound, terrifying.

**Offering.** Not words. Not language. But communication nevertheless. An offer. A transaction. A choice, though "choice" implies more agency than he actually had in that moment.

*You're dying,* the presence communicated. Not a statement—a fact. An observation. He was dying. Not his body, which continued its endless regeneration. His self was dying. The thing that made him a person was ending.

*I can sustain you,* it offered. *I can give you power. Life beyond life. The ability to heal not just yourself but others. To feel their pain as your own. To carry suffering as currency. To become a conduit for something older than the gods who claim to rule healing.*

*What's the cost?* Rust asked, or thought, or somehow communicated back to this impossible presence.

*You'll carry me,* it answered. *Part of me will live in you. You'll never be fully alone again. Never be fully yourself again. You'll be changed. Different. Other. And you'll never fully understand what I am or why I chose you.*

Rust, or what remained of Rust, considered this. In the space between death and transformation, time moved differently. The choice took an instant and an eternity simultaneously.

He thought of [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]]. Still in the monastery. Still suffering. Still waiting for him to come back from Velenne's study and tell her he'd survived another night.

He thought of ten years of survival. Of mapping the monastery. Of learning languages and mathematics and gardening. Of accumulating knowledge and strategies and tiny rebellions. Of refusing to be completely broken even when breaking seemed inevitable.

He thought of the emptiness where his self had been. Of the peace of ending. Of how tired he was.

And he chose.

Not life exactly. Not power exactly. But continuation. The ability to keep going. The chance to escape. The possibility of protecting someone who needed him.

*Yes,* he answered the vast presence. *Whatever you are. Whatever this costs. Yes.*

The presence surged into him.

## The Manifestation

The change was immediate and catastrophic.

Power flooded through Rust's body—not gentle, not controlled, not anything like the healing he'd experienced for ten years. This was wild. Primal. Vast beyond his capacity to contain.

His eyes opened—but they weren't entirely his eyes anymore. Something else looked through them too.

The leather restraints snapped. Not because he pulled against them. They simply... failed. Weakened. Undone by proximity to something that didn't acknowledge their authority.

Sister Velenne looked up from her notes. Her expression shifted from clinical focus to confusion to something that might have been fear.

"What—"

Rust sat up. The movement was his but also not his. Powered by will but also by something else. Something that had noticed his breaking and decided he was worth sustaining.

He looked at Sister Velenne. Really looked at her. And for the first time in ten years, he didn't feel fear. Didn't feel hatred. Didn't feel anything personal at all.

He felt her. Her pain. Her history. Her damage. The thing that had broken her long before she started breaking children. The wound at her core that she'd tried to fill with control and knowledge and the systematic destruction of things smaller than herself.

He felt it all. Absorbed it. Carried it the way his new power demanded he carry all suffering in his proximity.

It was overwhelming. Terrible. A glimpse into the reality that every person was damaged, every person carried pain, every person was both victim and perpetrator of countless small cruelties.

"You're hurt," he said. His voice was his but also not his. Younger than his body, older than his years, layered with something that resonated at frequencies human ears weren't designed to process.

Velenne stepped back. "What did you do?"

"You broke me," Rust said simply. "So something else put me back together. Not the way I was. Different."

He stood. His body obeyed perfectly—no pain, no weakness, no residual damage from hours of torture. He felt strong. Whole. Alive in a way he'd never been before.

And terrifyingly other.

"You need to leave," Velenne said, reaching for something on her desk—a bell to summon other Sisters, maybe, or a weapon.

Rust didn't stop her. He just looked at her, and in that look was everything: ten years of suffering, of survival, of refusing to be broken. And now, transcendence of a sort. Transformation. The end of one story and the beginning of another.

"I'm leaving," he agreed. "I'm taking Mika. Don't follow us."

"You can't—"

"I can," he interrupted. "Whatever I am now... the monastery can't hold it. Can't hold me. You tried to make me into nothing. You accidentally made me into something else."

## The Escape

The escape itself was almost anticlimactic after the awakening.

Rust walked through the [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|monastery]] like a ghost. Sisters saw him—several tried to stop him—but something about him now made them hesitate. Made them step back. Made them uncertain.

He wasn't threatening them. He didn't need to. He'd become something that existed outside their framework of control.

He found Mika in the dormitory. She was awake—the other children had woken when the commotion started—sitting on her cot, watching the door.

"Rust?" she whispered when she saw him. Then, uncertainly, "You look different."

"I am different," he admitted. "We're leaving. Now. Come with me."

"They'll stop us—"

"They won't."

And they didn't. Rust led Mika through corridors he'd mapped for years, toward the exit he'd identified as most vulnerable. Sisters saw them. A few tried to block their path. But Rust just looked at them, and they stepped aside.

Not because he forced them. Because something about him now—the presence living inside him, the power radiating from his small frame—made them reconsider whether stopping him was worth the cost.

At the east wall, the one with crumbling mortar he'd identified years ago during [[06 - Survival Strategies|his mapping]], Rust boosted Mika up. She climbed. He followed.

Behind them, the monastery began to stir properly—bells ringing, voices shouting, torches lighting.

But it was too late. They were over the wall. Running into the darkness beyond. Two children fleeing into a world neither of them knew, powered by desperation and Rust's new and terrible gift.

## The Separation

They made it three miles before Rust realized he couldn't take Mika with him.

Not because he didn't want to. But because she was human. Visible. Trackable. And he needed to move fast, move invisible, move in spaces where a human child couldn't follow.

They stopped in a copse of trees as dawn began to break. Mika was exhausted, gasping, terrified. Rust felt her fear as if it was his own—his new power making him too aware of her suffering.

"I can't keep up," she said, crying. "I'm sorry. I'm trying—"

"It's not your fault," Rust said. "But I need to get further from the monastery. They'll be looking. Sending search parties. I'm too distinctive. They'll find me if I stay near roads or settlements."

"What are you saying?"

"I'm saying you need to go somewhere safe. Somewhere they won't look. There's a village five miles north—I memorized the maps in Velenne's study. You tell them you escaped from the monastery. They'll help you. They have to help you—it's the law."

"And you?"

"I go somewhere else. Somewhere they can't track me."

Mika was crying harder now. "You're abandoning me."

"I'm saving you," Rust said, though the distinction felt hollow even to him. "If you stay with me, they'll find us both. If you go to the village, you have a chance. They won't connect you to me if enough time passes."

"When will I see you again?"

Rust had no answer. The honest answer was "probably never." The kind answer was "someday." He chose neither.

"I don't know," he said. "But I'll try. When I'm stronger. When it's safe. I'll try to find you."

It was a promise he didn't know if he could keep. But it was the only thing he could give her.

They hugged. Brief. Fierce. Desperate. Then Rust pointed north.

"Five miles. Ask for the magistrate. Tell them what happened. Leave me out of it completely—say you escaped alone. They'll believe you. Humans always believe human children over goblin ones."

Mika nodded, unable to speak.

Rust turned south. Toward the wilderness. Toward uncertainty. Toward whatever life he could build with his new and terrible power.

He didn't look back. Looking back would have broken his resolve.

Behind him, Mika stood watching until he disappeared into the trees. Then she turned north and began walking toward a future without the only friend she'd ever had.

Both of them carrying guilt. Both of them alone.

Both of them changed forever by ten years in a place designed to break children.

## Reflection: Age 13

*That night broke reality for me. Not metaphorically—literally. The rules that governed my existence stopped applying. The person I'd been died on Velenne's table. What came back wasn't fully human, or fully goblin, or fully anything.*

*Something noticed me. Something vast and old and alien. It lives in me now. I feel it sometimes—not as a voice or presence exactly, but as a weight. A purpose I don't fully understand. A power I can barely control.*

*I heal people now. But it's not kind. It's not gentle. I feel their pain when I touch them. I absorb their suffering into myself. Every healing carries a cost, and I'm the one who pays it.*

*The Sisters would call it a curse. They'd be partly right. But it's also the thing that saved me. That let me escape. That gives me the ability to help others the way no one helped me.*

*I think about that night constantly. The moment I said yes to something I didn't understand. The choice to become other rather than cease being at all. The price I'm still paying, will always pay, for survival.*

*Was it worth it? I'm alive. I escaped. I have power to help others. But I'm also forever changed. Forever carrying something that isn't me. Forever slightly disconnected from full humanity.*

*I don't regret it. But I don't celebrate it either. It just... is. The thing that happened. The transformation that made me into whatever I am now.*

*And Mika. I left her in those trees. Told myself it was for her safety. Maybe it was. Maybe it was just cowardice. Maybe both.*

*I promised I'd find her. I haven't yet. That promise is the guilt I wake up with every morning. The debt I owe. The thing I have to make right before I can call myself anything other than a coward who survived by abandoning the only person who mattered.*

*But I'm getting stronger. Learning control. Figuring out this power. And when I'm ready—when I'm strong enough—I'll go back. For her. For the others still trapped there.*

*For the goblin child who died on that table so something else could live.*

*That's the promise I make to the person I used to be.*
