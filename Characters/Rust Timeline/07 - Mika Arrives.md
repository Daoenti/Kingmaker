# Someone Worth Protecting: Age 10

*Content Warning: This narrative deals with the formation of attachment bonds in an abusive environment, the attempt to protect someone more vulnerable, and the emotional complexity of caring for someone you cannot save.*

## The New Arrival

[[Characters/Rust|Rust]] was ten years old when [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]] arrived at the [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|monastery]].

He noticed her immediately during morning assembly—a small human girl, maybe seven years old, with tangled dark hair and eyes that hadn't yet learned to hide fear. She stood apart from the other children, trembling slightly, still wearing the stained travel clothes she'd arrived in. Her hands were clenched into fists at her sides, and she kept glancing toward the door as if calculating escape routes.

Rust recognized that look. He'd worn it himself, eight years ago.

[[NPCs/Sister Malhana|Sister Malhana]] introduced her with the usual clinical efficiency: "This is Mika. She will be joining your community. Show her the proper behavior expected of orphans in service to Asmodeus."

The other children barely glanced at her. New arrivals were common enough, and most learned quickly not to form attachments. Connections were vulnerabilities. Friendships were leverage the Sisters could exploit. Better to remain alone, focused on individual survival.

Rust had believed that too, for years. But something about this girl—the way she held herself rigid against terror, the defiant set of her jaw even as her eyes betrayed her fear—reminded him so strongly of his younger self that he couldn't look away.

*She won't last a month if someone doesn't help her,* he thought. *The Sisters will break her in weeks.*

He didn't plan to intervene. He'd learned long ago that trying to protect others usually made things worse for everyone. But plans, he was discovering, mattered less than impulse when someone reminded you too much of your own pain.

## The First Exchange

It happened during the evening meal, three days after Mika's arrival.

She was sitting alone at the end of a bench, picking at the thin gruel that passed for dinner. Rust noticed [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] watching her with that particular calculating expression she wore when identifying new test subjects. When Velenne began moving toward Mika, Rust acted without thinking.

He stood, walked to Mika's bench, and sat down beside her.

"You need to eat faster," he said quietly, keeping his voice low enough that the Sisters couldn't hear. "They time our meals. If you're still eating when they call time, they take it away and you go hungry until tomorrow."

Mika looked at him with wide, suspicious eyes. "Why are you telling me this?"

"Because you're new. Someone should have told me when I first came here." He picked up his own bowl, demonstrating. "Small bites, steady pace. Don't look like you're enjoying it—that invites attention. Don't look like you're suffering—that also invites attention. Just eat mechanically, like it's a task to complete."

She studied him for a long moment, then slowly began eating the way he'd shown her. He noticed her hands were shaking.

"What's your name?" she whispered.

"Rust."

"That's not a real name."

"No," he agreed. "But it's the one they gave me, and using any other would be punished. You'll learn that too."

From across the refectory, Sister Velenne was still watching them. Rust felt her gaze like a weight on his shoulders. He'd just made himself visible by showing kindness to another child. That was dangerous. But he'd also potentially redirected Velenne's attention away from Mika, at least temporarily.

He'd think about the consequences later. For now, the girl was eating properly, and that was enough.

## Teaching Survival

Over the following weeks, Rust found himself seeking Mika out with increasing frequency. Not obviously—that would have invited punishment. But in small moments between supervised activities, during garden work, in the few minutes before sleep when the Sisters weren't actively watching.

He taught her everything he'd learned about survival:

**The Rules:** "Never look a Sister directly in the eye unless ordered to. Never ask 'why' about anything. When you're hit, don't cry out—that's what they want. When you're praised, don't smile—it's always a trap."

**The Routines:** "Morning bell is at 5 AM. You have seven minutes to dress and be in the chapel. The water in the washbasin is cold, but if you wait until everyone else is done, there's a spot near the back where steam from the kitchen rises through a gap in the floor. The water there is almost warm."

**The Safe Spaces:** "The garden is best. Sister Malhana supervises, and she's strict but not cruel. The scriptorium is dangerous—that's where Sister Velenne conducts her 'lessons.' The punishment cells are in the east wing. If you hear someone being taken there, don't react. Don't show sympathy. They're watching for weaknesses."

**The Coping Strategies:** "When it gets bad, count things. Count stones in the wall. Count seconds between breaths. Count anything. It gives your mind something to hold onto that isn't the pain."

Mika absorbed everything with fierce concentration. She was quick—quicker than most children her age. Within two weeks, she'd learned to move through the monastery like she'd been there for months. The other children started to forget she was new.

But Sister Velenne didn't forget. And neither did Rust.

## The Bond Forms

Friendship in the monastery was a strange, constrained thing. They couldn't be seen talking too often. They couldn't show affection or concern openly. Every interaction had to be careful, measured, appearing casual to anyone watching.

But within those constraints, something real developed.

Mika was funny, Rust discovered. When the Sisters weren't around, she had a sharp, dark sense of humor that made him laugh for the first time in years. She'd make quiet observations about the monastery's absurdities—the way Sister Hester's left eye twitched when she was lying about Asmodeus's love, the way Sister Carmella's robes were always stained because she was secretly eating the good food meant for ceremonies.

"We're all going to die here, aren't we?" Mika said one night, lying in her cot across from his in the dormitory.

Rust was quiet for a long moment. The honest answer was probably yes. But he found himself saying, "Maybe not. People have escaped before."

"Really?"

"No," he admitted. "But that doesn't mean it's impossible."

Mika laughed softly, darkly. "You're a terrible liar, Rust."

"I know."

She was silent for a while, then whispered, "Thank you. For helping me. You didn't have to."

"I know that too."

"Why did you?"

Rust didn't have a good answer. Because she reminded him of himself? Because having someone to protect gave him purpose beyond mere survival? Because caring about another person made him feel less like the thing the Sisters were trying to turn him into?

"I don't know," he said finally. "But I'm glad I did."

In the darkness, he could hear her breathing steady into something like peace. It was the first time since her arrival that she'd fallen asleep without crying.

## The Cost of Connection

Having someone to care about changed Rust's calculations about survival.

Before Mika, his strategies were entirely self-focused: map the monastery, learn useful skills, avoid attracting attention, wait for opportunity. Simple, if brutal.

Now he found himself taking risks he'd never have taken alone:

When Mika was assigned punishment detail in the cold storage rooms during winter, Rust deliberately misbehaved to earn the same assignment, so she wouldn't be alone in the freezing dark.

When she was sick with fever and the Sisters wouldn't provide medicine, he stole herbs from the garden—risking severe punishment—to make a tea that might help.

When Sister Velenne began watching Mika with that clinical interest she'd once reserved for Rust, he made himself more visible, more interesting, drawing Velenne's attention back to himself.

Each act of protection was dangerous. Each one made him more vulnerable. The Sisters had figured out that Mika mattered to him, which meant they now had leverage they didn't have before.

But Rust couldn't stop. Having something worth protecting, someone whose survival mattered as much as his own, made the unbearable slightly more bearable. It gave him a reason beyond spite to keep going.

## The Guilt Begins

Not every day was dark. There were moments of genuine lightness:

Mika finding a bird's nest in the garden and watching the eggs hatch with wonder that even the monastery couldn't kill. Rust teaching her to read from the books in the scriptorium, watching her face light up when words made sense. The two of them inventing a simple sign language for the moments when speaking was too dangerous, small gestures meaning "be careful" or "well done" or "I'm here."

But underneath the connection, Rust felt the first stirrings of something that would haunt him for years: guilt.

Because he knew things Mika didn't yet understand. He knew the monastery would try to destroy her, the same way it had tried to destroy him. He knew Sister Velenne's "experiments" would probably extend to her eventually. He knew that staying here meant slow erosion of everything that made a person themselves.

And he knew that when opportunity came for escape—if it came—he might have to choose between his survival and hers.

*I should be preparing her for escape too,* he thought, lying awake at night. *Teaching her not just survival, but resistance. Getting her ready to run when the moment comes.*

But he didn't. Because preparing her for escape meant acknowledging that escape might be possible, and if it was possible and they failed, the punishment would be worse than death. Better to keep her focused on daily survival, on not attracting attention, on staying small and invisible.

Better to protect her from hope, because hope in this place was just another form of suffering.

Or so he told himself.

## What Friendship Meant

At ten years old, Rust was learning what it meant to care about someone in a place designed to prevent caring.

It meant fear multiplied—now he worried not just about his own pain, but about hers. It meant joy halved—every small happiness was tainted by knowing she still suffered. It meant constant calculation—balancing his safety against hers, always trying to figure out how to minimize total harm.

But it also meant something the Sisters couldn't understand or quantify:

It meant purpose beyond survival. It meant someone who knew him—not the mask he wore for the Sisters, but the person underneath. It meant quiet moments of shared understanding that made the isolation slightly less complete. It meant proof that the monastery hadn't entirely succeeded in making him into something that couldn't love.

The Sisters believed that love was weakness, that attachment was vulnerability, that the purpose of community was obedience rather than connection.

They were right that attachment made him vulnerable. But they were wrong about what that vulnerability meant.

Because having someone worth protecting didn't make Rust weaker. It made him more careful, more strategic, more determined. It gave him a reason to plan for a future beyond mere survival. It taught him that he could be something other than a victim or a tool—he could be a friend, a protector, someone who mattered to someone else.

The Sisters had created the conditions for friendship by making the children's suffering collective. They'd tried to prevent friendship by making connection dangerous. But they'd failed to understand that humans—even broken ones, even children raised in darkness—found ways to care about each other anyway.

It was perhaps the most defiant thing Rust had ever done: choosing to love someone in a place built to kill love.

And though he didn't know it yet, that choice would define everything that came after.

## Reflection: Age 13

*I think about Mika every day. I don't know if she's alive. I don't know if the Sisters punished her for my escape, or if she got out somehow, or if she's still there, wondering why I left her behind.*

*That's the guilt I carry. Not that I escaped—that was survival, and I won't apologize for surviving. But that I didn't take her with me. That when the opportunity came, I ran alone. That I made a choice between her life and mine, and I chose mine.*

*Some days I tell myself I had no choice. That taking her would have meant we both got caught. That she was seven when I left, too young to survive on the road, too visible as a human girl to blend into goblin spaces the way I could.*

*Other days I know those are just excuses. I was terrified, and I ran, and I left her in that place.*

*I tell myself I'll go back for her someday. That I'll get strong enough, smart enough, powerful enough to free her. That's what I'm working toward—not just answers about my curse, but the strength to face the monastery again and pull her out of that darkness.*

*But I also know that 'someday' might never come. That she might already be dead, or broken, or so changed by what they've done to her that the girl I knew doesn't exist anymore.*

*Mika taught me that caring about someone doesn't make you weak. But she also taught me that caring about someone means living with the consequences of every choice you make about their safety.*

*I loved her like a sister. I abandoned her to save myself. Both of those things are true, and I have to live with that contradiction.*

*If she's alive, I'll find her. That's a promise I make to myself every morning. If she's alive, I'll find her, and I'll make it right.*

*But if she's not... then I have to live with that too.*
