# The Breaking Point Approaches: Age 11

*Content Warning: This narrative contains descriptions of systematic torture, psychological abuse, escalating violence against a child, medical experimentation without consent, and the deliberate attempt to destroy a child's will to live. This is the darkest period of Rust's timeline.*

## The Shift in Sister Velenne's Methods

At eleven years old, [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] had been [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]]'s primary research subject for five years. He thought he understood the patterns of her cruelty—the rhythms of experimentation, the cycles of pain and recovery, the clinical detachment with which she documented his suffering.

He was wrong.

Something changed in Sister Velenne during his eleventh year. Her experiments became more frequent, more severe, less concerned with his long-term survival. The careful scientist who'd once waited for him to heal between sessions was replaced by something more desperate, more driven.

Later, Rust would understand why: Velenne was running out of time. He was approaching adolescence, and whatever she hoped to learn from his unusual healing ability, she needed to learn it soon. Once he reached physical maturity, the opportunity for studying childhood resilience would be gone.

But at eleven, he didn't understand the urgency. He only knew that the torture was escalating, and he was running out of ways to endure it.

## The Experiments Intensify

The sessions in Velenne's private study became nightmares with an academic veneer:

**Week 1:** "Let's test the limits of your regeneration, Subject Rust. Hold still."

The knife was small, precise, surgical. She made careful cuts along his arms, his legs, his chest—each one measured, documented, timed for healing. She noted how quickly the blood stopped, how the skin knit together, whether scars formed (they never did).

"Fascinating," she murmured, writing in her leather journal. "Complete cellular regeneration in approximately forty-seven minutes. No visible scarring. No apparent pain threshold increase despite repeated trauma."

Rust learned to leave his body during these sessions. To focus on the texture of the stone wall behind her, or the pattern of cracks in the ceiling, or the mental map of the [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|monastery]] he'd spent years building. Anything but the present moment.

**Week 3:** "Today we test structural damage. This will hurt more."

Broken bones. Velenne was methodical about it—documenting the sound of the break, the speed of healing, whether the bone set properly without intervention. His right arm first, then his left. Then ribs, one at a time, while she took notes on his breathing difficulties.

"You're crying," she observed clinically. "But you're not screaming. Why not?"

"Because," Rust gasped through the pain, "screaming is what you want."

She smiled. "Intelligent, even under duress. Noted."

The bones healed wrong at first—too fast, without proper alignment. She had to re-break them so they'd set correctly. She documented this as "a limitation of accelerated healing: speed without precision."

**Week 5:** "Let's explore your tolerance for sustained trauma."

Burns. Chemical. Heat. Cold. Each one carefully calibrated, carefully timed, carefully observed. She wanted to know if his healing slowed with repeated injury, if there was a point where his body couldn't keep up with the damage.

There wasn't, as far as she could determine. His flesh renewed itself with the same uncanny efficiency no matter how much she destroyed.

"You should be dead," she told him after one particularly brutal session. "Multiple times over. Whatever sustains you... it's not natural. Not divine. Something else entirely."

She was fascinated by this mystery. Rust had become less a child to her and more a puzzle to solve before he aged out of usefulness.

## The Psychological Warfare

The physical torture was terrible, but Velenne was too sophisticated to rely on pain alone. She knew that breaking a person required breaking their mind, not just their body.

**Isolation:** Rust was separated from [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]] and the other children for increasingly long periods. Velenne's sessions grew longer—sometimes eight hours, sometimes twelve, sometimes stretching through an entire night. When he returned to the dormitory, he was too exhausted, too dissociated to interact with anyone.

Mika tried to reach him, but he could barely respond. He was learning to live inside his own head, in the spaces where pain couldn't quite reach. It was necessary for survival, but it meant losing his connection to the one person who made life bearable.

**Helplessness Training:** Velenne began timing her experiments to disrupt any sense of predictability. Sometimes she'd come for him daily. Sometimes she'd wait weeks, letting him hope the experiments had stopped. Then she'd resume without warning.

"You need to understand," she told him, "that you have no control. No agency. No ability to predict or prevent what happens to you. Acceptance of this is enlightenment. Resistance is delusion."

She was trying to induce learned helplessness—a state where he'd stop trying to resist, stop planning escape, stop hoping for anything better. Just accept his role as test subject, as object, as thing to be studied.

**Identity Erosion:** She stopped using his name—even the false name "Rust" the monastery had given him. In her notes, in her speech, he became "Subject," "the specimen," "it."

"You're not a person," she explained calmly. "Persons have rights, autonomy, social standing. You're a goblin orphan with an unusual medical condition. The difference is taxonomical, not moral. Objects don't suffer—they simply respond to stimuli. The sooner you internalize this, the less distressing you'll find our work together."

She was trying to make him believe his own dehumanization. And terrifyingly, after months of this, part of him started to wonder if she was right.

## The Failed Breaks

Three times during his eleventh year, Rust reached what felt like absolute breaking points:

**The First Break (Month 3):** After a particularly brutal session involving damage to his hands—Velenne wanted to see if fine motor control would be affected by healing—Rust found himself unable to move afterward. Not because of injury, but because something inside him had simply... stopped.

He lay on the cold floor of Velenne's study for hours, conscious but unreachable. She'd left him there, satisfied that the session was complete. When a Sister finally came to return him to the dormitory, he couldn't stand. Couldn't speak. Couldn't respond to questions or commands.

They carried him to his cot. Mika sat beside him through the night, holding his hand, whispering that he needed to come back.

By morning, he'd reassembled himself enough to function. But something had changed. A part of him had learned to shut down completely when the pain exceeded what consciousness could process.

**The Second Break (Month 7):** Velenne had begun experimenting with psychological torture in addition to physical. She'd learned that Rust cared about Mika, and she used this knowledge with surgical precision.

"If you don't cooperate with today's session," she told him, "I'll begin studying her instead. She's younger, more resilient in some ways. Fresh data would be valuable."

It was an empty threat—probably. Velenne's research focused specifically on his unusual healing. But Rust couldn't risk it. He endured three additional hours of experimentation without resistance, without even trying to dissociate, because staying present for his own torture meant protecting Mika from hers.

Afterward, he vomited for an hour. Not from physical pain, but from the psychological weight of choice: his suffering or hers. Velenne had turned his capacity for care into a weapon against him.

**The Third Break (Month 11):** The worst session. Velenne had acquired some kind of acid—she never said from where—and wanted to test whether his healing could handle caustic chemical damage.

It couldn't. Not fast enough.

The pain was beyond anything he'd experienced before. Beyond what dissociation could distance him from. Beyond what counting could distract him from. Beyond what endurance could outlast.

He screamed. He begged. He said things he'd sworn he'd never say: "please stop," "I can't," "I'll do anything."

Velenne documented his psychological breaking with the same clinical detachment she brought to physical observations. When his healing finally, slowly, agonizingly repaired the damage, she noted: "Subject reaches psychological breaking point before physical collapse. Interesting discrepancy between bodily resilience and mental fortitude."

That night, Rust seriously considered suicide for the first time.

He didn't have a method—the monastery was carefully designed to prevent such escapes. But he lay awake calculating possibilities. The garden shed had tools that could serve. The chapel had a balcony high enough that even his healing might not save him if he fell correctly.

He didn't act on these thoughts. Not because he found hope, but because he was too tired to execute a plan. Suicide required energy, and Velenne had taken everything he had.

## Mika's Intervention

It was [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]], ultimately, who pulled him back from the edge.

She was eight years old, barely surviving herself, carrying her own trauma from a year in the monastery. But she recognized the look in Rust's eyes—the particular exhaustion that meant someone was considering escape through death.

"You can't," she whispered one night, lying in her cot across from his in the darkness. "You can't leave me here alone."

"I'm not strong enough to stay," Rust admitted, his voice hollow.

"You are, though. You've always been strong enough. You just don't remember right now."

"She's breaking me, Mika. Velenne. Whatever I was, whatever I had inside that let me survive... she's destroying it piece by piece."

"Then build it back. Every day. Just a little bit." Mika's voice was fierce despite its softness. "You taught me that. Remember? When I first got here, you told me survival was about small victories. One day at a time. One hour at a time."

"I can't remember how to do that anymore."

"Then I'll remember for you. Until you can remember for yourself."

She reached across the gap between their cots and took his hand. A violation of monastery rules, but the Sisters weren't watching just then. Her hand was small, warm, steady.

"You told me people have escaped before," she said. "Maybe that was a lie. But I choose to believe it anyway. I choose to believe we'll escape. Both of us. Someday."

"That's not rational," Rust said, but he gripped her hand tighter.

"I don't care. Hope doesn't have to be rational. It just has to be enough to keep going."

They stayed like that for hours, hands linked in the darkness, neither speaking. It wasn't enough to erase the trauma or stop the experiments or undo the breaking. But it was enough to make it through that particular night.

And sometimes, in places like the monastery, that was all survival meant: making it through one more night. Then another. Then another. Until eventually, enough nights passed that escape became possible.

Rust didn't know that his escape was coming. Didn't know that in less than a year, his power would awaken and the monastery would burn behind him as he fled.

But Mika's intervention reminded him of something crucial: he wasn't just surviving for himself anymore. He was surviving because someone else needed him to. Because abandoning survival meant abandoning her.

It was burden and gift simultaneously. But it was enough to make him decide to keep going.

For now. For her. One more day.

## The Counting Down

After the third breaking, something fundamental shifted in Rust's approach to survival.

He stopped thinking long-term. Planning escape in the distant future felt impossible—he couldn't envision a future at all anymore. Instead, he focused on immediate survival, measured in increments small enough to manage:

*Make it through this session.*
*Heal enough to stand.*
*Eat something, even if you're not hungry.*
*Sleep for a few hours.*
*Wake up.*
*Make it through this session.*

The cycle repeated. Days blurred together. Weeks became indistinguishable. His eleventh year was a fog of pain, endurance, healing, pain again.

But underneath the fog, something was building. The same thing that had sustained him since age two, refined by nine years of survival, sharpened by escalating torture, focused by the need to protect Mika:

A will that refused to be entirely broken. A core of self that Velenne couldn't quite reach no matter how much she destroyed the flesh around it. A stubborn, defiant insistence on remaining *someone* even when being reduced to *something*.

Sister Velenne was trying to break him before he aged out of her research parameters.

She was running out of time.

He was running out of endurance.

Something was going to give. Soon.

He didn't know what would happen when he finally, truly broke. Whether he'd die, or go catatonic, or lose whatever made him himself.

He didn't know that breaking wasn't the end of his story—it was the beginning of something else entirely.

He didn't know that in the space between destruction and reconstruction, something vast and alien and primordial would notice him. Would reach out. Would offer power in exchange for... something. He still doesn't fully understand what.

At eleven years old, counting days in increments of pain, Rust only knew this:

He was going to break. It was inevitable.

The only question was what would happen after.

## Reflection: Age 13

*My eleventh year was hell. Not metaphorically—actual, literal hell. Sister Velenne tried to erase me. To turn me from a person into a thing. An object to study. Data to collect.*

*She almost succeeded.*

*I don't remember all of it clearly. Parts of that year are just... gone. Blanks where memories should be. My mind protected itself by refusing to record some of what happened. That's probably healthy, even if it means I'll never know the full scope of what she did.*

*What I do remember is the counting. Not counting down to escape—I didn't know escape was coming. Just counting to survive. One breath. One heartbeat. One moment. Then another. Then another.*

*And Mika. I remember Mika refusing to let me give up, even when giving up felt like the only rational choice.*

*People ask sometimes why I don't talk about the monastery much. This is why. This year. The year Sister Velenne tried to break me completely and almost succeeded. The year I learned that there are states worse than death—states where you're still conscious, still present, but everything that made you *you* has been systematically destroyed.*

*I survived it. But I'm not sure the person who went into that year is the same person who came out. Something broke that never fully healed, even with my unusual abilities.*

*Maybe that's what Sister Velenne never understood: you can heal flesh perfectly and still carry invisible wounds. You can repair every physical injury and still be broken in ways that matter more.*

*I carry that year with me every day. In the hypervigilance I can't turn off. In the nightmares where I'm back in her study. In the way I sometimes dissociate when stress gets too high, my mind retreating to that safe space where pain can't quite reach.*

*She wanted to break me. She got closer than anyone ever has.*

*But she failed. Because breaking implies something destroyed beyond repair. And I'm still here. Still fighting. Still becoming something she never imagined I could be.*

*That's not healing. Not really. But it's survival. And sometimes survival is its own form of victory.*
