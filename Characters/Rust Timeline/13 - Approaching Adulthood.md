Leaving Sevenarches was easier than staying among people.

Rust spent his first week out of the forest camped on its edges, watching the road from the tree line. People passed—merchants, travelers, a few adventurers. They looked normal. Talked normal. Moved through the world like it wasn't designed to hurt them.

That was the part Rust couldn't quite grasp. These people weren't afraid. They weren't constantly watching for threats or calculating escape routes. They just... existed. Laughed. Complained about weather and prices and ordinary problems. Lived in a world where safety was the default and danger was the exception.

Rust had never lived in that world. Wasn't sure he ever could.

But he couldn't live in the forest forever either.

On the eighth day, he walked into a small settlement whose name he never learned. It had maybe twenty buildings, a well, and a general store that also served as tavern and trading post. Rust had three copper pieces he'd found in the burned wreckage of the monastery, carefully saved. He spent one on bread that was two days stale but still the best thing he'd eaten in months.

The shopkeeper, [[NPCs/Marta Greenhill|Marta Greenhill]], a middle-aged human woman with flour in her hair, barely looked at him. "Traveling with family?" she asked, the same tone she might use to discuss weather.

"No," Rust said, because lying seemed more complicated than the truth.

She glanced at him then, really seeing him for the first time. Small for his age, too thin, clothes that had been worn by multiple people before him. A goblin in human spaces, alone, with nothing.

He waited for judgment. For rejection. For the carefully disguised cruelty the Sisters had taught him was the natural response to his existence.

Instead, she said, "Well, that bread's on the house then. You look like you need it more than I need the copper."

Rust stared at her, completely lost.

She waved him toward the door. "Go on now, before you draw flies standing there gawking."

He left. Sat outside the settlement for an hour trying to understand what had just happened. The Sisters would have called it charity, but they'd always made charity feel like punishment, like proof that you were lesser and should be grateful for even the smallest kindness.

This hadn't felt like that. It had felt... casual. Like feeding a hungry kid was just what you did, no ceremony required.

Rust ate the bread slowly, making it last, trying to figure out which version of the world was real—the monastery's, or this.
