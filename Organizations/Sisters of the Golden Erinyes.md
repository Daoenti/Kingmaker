# Sisters of the Golden Erinyes

## Overview
**Alignment:** Lawful Evil
**Headquarters:** [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|Monastery of the Golden Erinyes]], western [[Locations/Isger|Isger]]
**Deity:** [[Deities/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]]
**Founded:** Shortly after the [[Events/Goblinblood Wars|Goblinblood Wars]]
**Current Status:** Active and operating

## Purpose and Philosophy
The Sisters ostensibly run a charitable institution dedicated to civilizing goblinoid orphans and other undesirable children in post-war [[Locations/Isger|Isger]]. In practice, they operate a systematic abuse mill disguised as theological education.

Their core doctrine: **order through pain, salvation through submission**. They believe suffering is the pathway to enlightenment, that breaking a creature's will is the first step to saving its soul, and that absolute obedience to divine hierarchy (with [[Deities/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]] at the apex) is the only path to meaning.

They see goblinoid children as perfect test cases - beings so low in the cosmic order that transforming them proves the universality of their methods. If even a goblin can be civilized through sufficient suffering, their doctrine must be correct.

## Methods
- Systematic physical abuse disguised as discipline
- Psychological manipulation wrapped in scripture
- Deliberate humiliation and dehumanization
- Isolation and deprivation as teaching tools
- Forced labor as character building
- Theological indoctrination through pain association

The Sisters maintain meticulous records of their successes - children who have been broken sufficiently to become obedient servants, some of whom even join the order or affiliated Hellknight organizations.

## Structure

### Leadership
- **High Sister:** Unknown name, rarely seen outside the monastery
- **Council of Discipline:** Senior sisters who set policy and doctrine
- **Administrative Branch:** Led by figures like [[NPCs/Sister Malhana|Sister Malhana]], handles intake and records
- **Correction Branch:** Led by figures like [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]], handles active education

### Resources
- Backing from certain Hellknight orders who appreciate their results
- Donations from Asmodean churches
- Funding from wealthy families disposing of unwanted children
- Labor from the orphans themselves

## Geographic Reach
Primarily operates in western [[Locations/Isger|Isger]], but has connections throughout the region. They occasionally take in problem children from as far as [[Locations/Druma|Druma]] and southern Cheliax.

Their reputation varies:
- **Official:** A stern but necessary institution bringing order to post-war chaos
- **Unofficial:** A horror story parents tell to frighten disobedient children
- **Reality:** A legitimized abuse operation that produces broken, obedient servants

## Notable Members
- [[NPCs/Sister Malhana|Sister Malhana]]: Senior Administrator, gave [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] his name
- [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]]: Discipline Mistress, primary abuser
- Others unnamed but numerous

## Known Victims
- [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]: Escaped after power manifestation, current whereabouts unknown to them
- [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]]: Human girl, status unknown
- Dozens of others, most of whom never escape

## Public Perception
The Sisters maintain a veneer of respectability. They are officially sanctioned, pay their taxes, and produce useful servants. Most people in [[Locations/Isger|Isger]] know the monastery is harsh but assume it is necessary harshness - the region is still recovering from the wars, and someone has to deal with the goblin orphans.

Those who know the truth either lack the power to stop them or benefit from their existence. The Hellknights appreciate institutions that produce obedient underlings. Wealthy families appreciate somewhere to dispose of embarrassing children. The Asmodean church appreciates the demonstration of their doctrine's effectiveness.

## Threat Assessment
**Direct Combat:** Moderate. The Sisters are not warriors, but they have guards and Hellknight connections.  
**Political:** High. They are legally sanctioned and connected to powerful organizations.  
**Psychological:** Extreme. They are experts at breaking people.  
**Information:** High. They keep detailed records on all graduates.

## Potential Plot Hooks
- Other escaped orphans seeking revenge or closure
- Investigation into their methods by reformist authorities
- [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] being tracked by Sisters who see his escape as unfinished business
- Party members with connections to families who have donated children
- Hellknight NPCs who were shaped by similar institutions
- Current orphans in need of rescue
- Records containing information about character backgrounds

## Weaknesses
- Dependent on legal sanction and social approval
- Records could expose true nature of methods
- Former victims like [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] who survived and remember
- Infighting between different branches with different interpretations of doctrine
- Vulnerable to exposure by anyone willing to investigate seriously
