## Description
Lamashtu is the Mother of Monsters, the mad goddess of monstrous births, aberrations, and nightmares. She is the patron deity of many monstrous races and those who feel cast out or rejected by civilized society. Unlike [[Deities/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]]'s calculated tyranny, Lamashtu represents primal chaos, the horror of the unnatural, and the terrifying randomness of mutation and madness.

She appears in many forms, most commonly as a pregnant woman with a jackal's head, bat wings, taloned feet, and a third eye in her forehead. She carries her falchion and births monsters into the world as acts of spite against the civilized order.

## Divine Philosophy

### Core Beliefs
Lamashtu's doctrine centers on several fundamental principles:

**Embrace the Monstrous:**
- Deformity and mutation are gifts, not curses
- Those rejected by society should become powerful enough to reject society in return
- Monstrousness is strength, not weakness
- Transformation through chaos and madness leads to power

**Survival of the Twisted:**
- Weak children should be culled or transformed
- Only the strongest, most adaptable survive
- Madness grants insight ordinary minds cannot comprehend
- Pain and suffering forge monstrous strength

**Rejection of Order:**
- Civilization is a cage that should be torn down
- Natural laws are meant to be broken
- The "normal" and "proper" should be perverted
- Chaos births new possibilities

**The Sacred Nightmare:**
- Dreams and madness reveal deeper truths
- Nightmares are sacred visions from the Mother
- Sanity is a prison; madness is freedom
- Terror is a form of worship

## Worship and Followers

### Goblinoid Worship
Lamashtu is the primary deity of goblins, though their worship is often instinctive rather than organized:
- Goblins see her as their creator and protector
- Goblin mothers invoke her name during birth
- Goblin shamans interpret her nightmares as prophecy
- Many goblins don't actively worship but acknowledge her existence
- Cultural rather than devotional for most goblins

### Other Worshippers
- **Gnolls:** Devoted servants who spread madness and destruction
- **Medusas, Harpies, Minotaurs:** Monstrous races she claims as her children
- **The Deformed:** Those born with mutations or aberrations
- **The Mad:** Especially those who hear voices or experience visions
- **Outcasts:** People rejected by society who embrace monstrousness
- **Dark Midwives:** Those who corrupt births or create monsters

### Clergy and Practices
Her priests and clerics often:
- Bear ritual scars, mutations, or deformities
- Interpret nightmares and madness as divine messages
- Corrupt pregnancies or "improve" children through dark rituals
- Spread disease, madness, and mutation as gifts
- Create safe havens for monstrous races
- Tear down symbols of civilization and order

## Relationship to Rust

### Nominal Deity
[[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s character sheet lists Lamashtu as his deity, but this relationship is complex:

**Cultural Association:**
- As a goblin, he's culturally associated with Lamashtu worship
- The [[Organizations/Sisters of the Golden Erinyes|Sisters]] likely assumed he worshipped her
- Other goblins might assume the same
- It's the "default" goblin deity

**Not Devotional:**
- Rust doesn't actively worship Lamashtu
- He doesn't pray to her or seek her favor
- He doesn't follow her doctrines
- He carries a wooden symbol but it's cultural, not devotional

**Complicated Feelings:**
- She represents what society expects him to be
- She's associated with the monstrousness others see in him
- His Unbreakable heritage could be interpreted as her "gift"
- His curse/oracle powers feel primordial, possibly connected to her domain

**Questions About Connection:**
- Is his Life Oracle power actually from Lamashtu?
- Does she notice him specifically?
- Is his Unbreakable nature her influence or something else?
- Does acknowledging her culturally mean she has a claim on him?

## Lamashtu vs. Other Deities

### Opposed to Order
Unlike [[Deities/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]], who represents tyrannical order:
- Lamashtu is pure chaos and madness
- She has no interest in hierarchies or systems
- She destroys rather than controls
- She corrupts rather than dominates

### Despised by Good Deities
- Desna (goddess of dreams) opposes her corruption of sleep
- Pharasma (goddess of birth/death) hates her perversion of childbirth
- Sarenrae and other good deities see her as pure evil
- Shelyn (goddess of beauty) opposes her celebration of deformity

### Relationship with Monsters
She claims dominion over monstrous races:
- Goblins, gnolls, minotaurs, medusas, lamias
- Aberrations and mutations
- Things born wrong or transformed
- Creatures rejected by civilized society

## In the Campaign World

### Lamashtu's Influence in Isger
In post-[[Events/Goblinblood Wars|Goblinblood Wars]] [[Locations/Isger|Isger]]:
- Many goblin survivors lost faith when she didn't protect them
- Some goblin shamans blame her abandonment for the genocide
- Others doubled down on worship, seeking her vengeance
- Asmodean clergy worked to suppress her worship entirely

### Cultural Impact
- Lamashtu is used as a boogeyman in human culture
- "Lamashtu's get" is an insult for deformed or monstrous children
- Pregnant women fear her influence on their unborn
- Her symbols are destroyed wherever found by civilized folk

### Potential Plot Hooks
- Does Lamashtu have designs on Rust?
- Are his powers actually her influence?
- Would claiming another deity put him at odds with her?
- What happens if he rejects her completely?
- Are there other Lamashtu cultists seeking him?

## Temples and Sacred Sites
Lamashtu rarely has formal temples:
- Hidden shrines in wilderness and ruins
- Caves decorated with twisted imagery
- Abandoned buildings claimed by her followers
- Places where the veil is thin and madness seeps through
- Sites of monstrous births or great tragedies

## Holy Days and Observances
- **The Sowing of Nightmares:** Midwinter, when her faithful spread terror
- **The Birth Feast:** When monstrous children are celebrated
- **Moonless Nights:** Sacred times for dark rituals
- **Times of Madness:** When her followers embrace insanity as divine gift

## Sacred Creatures
- Jackals (especially three-eyed or deformed)
- Bats and owls
- Snakes and scorpions
- Any creature born deformed or mutated
- Monsters and aberrations

## Philosophical Questions

### For Rust at Age 13
- Can he reject Lamashtu while still being goblin?
- Is his power from her, or something else entirely?
- Does acknowledging her existence mean accepting her claim?
- What would happen if he actively opposed her?
- Is monstrousness destiny or choice?

### Larger Questions
- Are monsters truly her children or victims?
- Is madness divine insight or just disease?
- Can the "gifts" she offers be turned to good?
- What drives someone to embrace monstrousness?
- Is transformation always corruption?

## Contrast with Rust's Journey

Lamashtu represents what Rust actively resists:
- **She celebrates monstrousness:** He tries to prove goblins aren't monsters
- **She embraces chaos:** He seeks understanding and control
- **She corrupts and destroys:** He heals and preserves
- **She revels in madness:** He fights to stay sane despite trauma
- **She claims ownership:** He seeks independence

Yet some uncomfortable parallels exist:
- Both associated with aberrant power
- Both exist outside normal order
- Both represent rejection by civilized society
- Both are seen as monstrous by others

## Symbols and Iconography
- Three-eyed jackal head (primary symbol)
- Pregnant woman with monstrous features
- Falchion dripping blood
- Deformed children
- Nightmarish creatures
- Broken chains (freedom from order)

*"The Mother of Monsters claims all the unwanted, the deformed, the rejected. Whether they worship her or not, she calls them her children. The question is whether they answer."*
