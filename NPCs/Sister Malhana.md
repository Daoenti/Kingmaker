# Sister Malhana

## Overview
**Role:** Senior Administrator at the [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|Monastery of the Golden Erinyes]]
**Organization:** [[Organizations/Sisters of the Golden Erinyes|Sisters of the Golden Erinyes]]
**Status:** Active
**Location:** [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|Monastery]], western [[Locations/Isger|Isger]]

## Description
Sister Malhana is an older woman, thin and angular, with a scholar's stoop and ink-stained fingers. Unlike [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]], she doesn't personally administer punishments. Her violence is bureaucratic, administrative, expressed through records and assignments rather than rods and switches.

She speaks in the measured tones of someone cataloging specimens, clinical and detached.

## Role at the Monastery
Malhana handles intake of new orphans, assignment of duties, and record-keeping. She named [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] after noting his rust-colored skin with clinical detachment: *"Even worthless metal can be beaten into something useful."*

This perfectly encapsulates her approach: children are raw materials to be processed, categorized, and shaped into useful forms. She's not cruel in the visceral way Velenne isâ€"her cruelty is the cold indifference of paperwork and policy.

## Personality
Detached, methodical, sees people as data points in a theological project. She likely doesn't remember [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] specifically; he was just one more entry in the ledger of salvaged souls. This impersonality might be even more disturbing to Rust than Velenne's focused attention.

## Relationship to Rust
She gave him his name and his initial classification within the monastery hierarchy. Beyond that, she likely had minimal direct contact. To her, he was case file GBL-47 or similar, a goblin specimen to be civilized or discarded based on results.
