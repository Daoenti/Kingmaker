# Kresh

## Overview
**Role:** Mercenary and caravan guard
**Species:** Half-orc
**Status:** Unknown (last seen in northern Andoran)
**Relationship to [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]:** Brief mentor figure during caravan journey

## Description
A grizzled half-orc mercenary with the scars and bearing of someone who's made a career of violence. Professional, competent, and surprisingly observant. Kresh carries himself with the confidence of someone who's survived dozens of fights through skill rather than luck.

## Personality
Professional and pragmatic. Kresh doesn't waste words or motion. He's seen enough of the world to recognize when someone's running from something, and he's practical enough not to pry unless it matters. He has the teacher's instinct to pass on knowledge when he sees potential, but without sentimentality about it.

Direct, honest, and matter-of-fact about violence. He doesn't glorify combat but treats it as a craft to be learned properly.

## Relationship to Rust
Kresh was one of six guards on a merchant caravan heading south toward Andoran when [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] signed on at age twelve. Over the three-week journey, Kresh observed Rust during practice sessions and noted his potential despite lack of training.

**Key Contribution:** Taught Rust basic knife fighting fundamentals:
- How to use size as an advantage
- Targeting joints and sensitive areas when strength is against you
- Making every motion count
- Ending fights quickly rather than enduring them

**Critical Observation:** *"You're quick. But you fight like you're trying to escape, not win. That'll get you killed."*

When Rust admitted he usually was trying to escape, Kresh didn't push for details. He simply shifted his teaching to focus on practical survival—how to be too difficult a target to bother with.

## Current Status
Unknown. After the caravan reached its destination, Kresh collected his pay and moved on to the next job. Rust doesn't know where he went or whether he's still alive. The mercenary's life is dangerous and he'd be in his forties by now.

## Impact on Rust
Kresh represented a different kind of strength than what [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] taught. Where Velenne's lessons were about enduring pain, Kresh taught about avoiding it. Where Velenne's violence was punishment, Kresh's teaching was preparation.

More importantly, Kresh treated Rust as someone worth teaching without expecting gratitude, transformation, or payment beyond his agreed wage. The interaction was transactional but not cruel—a simple exchange of knowledge for attention.

This casual respect, given without strings attached, was novel enough to stick with Rust years later.

## Motivations
- Making a living through mercenary work
- Passing on practical knowledge to those who might need it
- Staying alive in a dangerous profession

## Quotes
*"You're quick. But you fight like you're trying to escape, not win. That'll get you killed."*

*"Fair. But sometimes you can't run. Might as well learn to end fights fast when you can't."*
