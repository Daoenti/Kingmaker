# Sister Velenne

## Overview
**Role:** Discipline Mistress at the [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|Monastery of the Golden Erinyes]]  
**Organization:** [[Organizations/Sisters of the Golden Erinyes|Sisters of the Golden Erinyes]]  
**Status:** Active (as far as [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] knows)  
**Location:** [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|Monastery of the Golden Erinyes]], western [[Locations/Isger|Isger]]

## Description
Sister Velenne is a tall, severe woman in her forties with iron-gray hair kept in a tight bun. She wears the traditional black and gold robes of the Sisters, always immaculate despite her violent work. Her hands are strong and calloused from years of wielding the discipline rod, and her eyes hold the absolute certainty of someone who believes brutality is holy.

She moves with measured precision, never hurried, never uncertain. Every action is deliberate, justified by scripture, sanctified by her faith in [[Deities/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]]'s divine order.

## Personality
Velenne is a true believer in the most dangerous sense. She genuinely thinks her abuse is mercy, her cruelty is kindness, and suffering is the path to salvation. She's not sadistic in the traditional senseâ€"she doesn't take pleasure in pain for its own sake. Instead, she views breaking children as **sacred duty**, a service to both the victims and the cosmic order.

She's intelligent, well-versed in Asmodean theology, and capable of justifying any atrocity with scriptural reference. She's patient, methodical, and utterly convinced of her righteousness. This makes her far more dangerous than a simple bully.

## Relationship to Rust
Velenne took "particular interest" in [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s education, seeing him as a special projectâ€"proof that even a goblin, the lowest of creatures, could be remade through proper application of discipline. She beat him regularly, methodically, always with theological justification.

When his healing abilities began manifesting around age twelve, she initially saw it as defiance, as if he were willfully rejecting her corrections. She increased the severity of her punishments, determined to break through whatever resistance he was offering.

The night of [[Events/Rust's Awakening|his final beating]], she worked him over with unprecedented zeal after catching him helping [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]]. She left him locked in the discipline chamber, expecting to find him appropriately broken come morning. Instead, she found him gone.

## Current Status
Rust doesn't know if Velenne is still at the monastery or even still alive. He assumes she continues her "work," breaking other children in the name of divine order. The thought haunts him.

If she learned he escaped and developed unusual healing abilities, she might see finding him as unfinished businessâ€"a soul not yet properly saved, a project abandoned before completion.

## Motivations
- Absolute belief in Asmodean doctrine
- Conviction that suffering purifies and redeems
- Need to prove that any creature, even goblins, can be civilized through pain
- Maintaining order and hierarchy as divine mandate

## Threat Assessment
**Direct Threat:** High if [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] is found  
**Resources:** The full backing of the [[Organizations/Sisters of the Golden Erinyes|Sisters]] and tangential Hellknight connections  
**Danger:** Her certainty makes her unpredictable; she'd pursue Rust as a matter of principle, not just practicality

## Potential Plot Hooks
- Velenne has been searching for Rust, seeing his escape as personal failure
- She's heard rumors of a goblin healer and is investigating
- Other "graduates" of the monastery have their own scores to settle
- She's risen in the organization and has greater resources now
- She's developed methods to counter or suppress healing magic
