# Marta Greenhill

## Overview

**Role:** Shopkeeper and tavern keeper

**Species:** Human

**Age:** Middle-aged (around 40 when Rust met her)

**Status:** Unknown (presumably still running her shop)

**Location:** Small settlement in southern Kyonin, near the Sevenarches border

**Relationship to [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]:** First person to show him casual kindness after his escape

## Description
A middle-aged human woman with flour perpetually dusted in her hair and on her apron. She runs a general store that also serves as tavern and trading post in a settlement of maybe twenty buildings. Practical, no-nonsense, with the worn hands of someone who's worked hard all her life.

She has the shopkeeper's habit of seeing people clearly—assessing their needs and means in a glance—but without judgment attached to the observation.

## Personality
Matter-of-fact and practical. Marta doesn't make grand gestures or speeches about charity. She sees a hungry kid and feeds him, the same way she'd fix a leaking roof or sweep the floor—because it needs doing and she can do it.

Not particularly warm or effusive, but fundamentally decent. She asks questions out of practical concern ("Traveling with family?") rather than nosiness, and doesn't push when the answers are incomplete.

## Relationship to Rust
Marta was the first person [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] encountered after leaving Sevenarches. He'd been alone for eight months—six in the forest, two more on its edges—working up the courage to enter a settlement.

**The Encounter:**
- Rust bought stale bread with one of his three copper pieces
- Marta asked casually if he was traveling with family
- When he said no, she actually looked at him: small, too thin, clothes worn by multiple people before him, alone
- Instead of the judgment or cruelty he expected, she gave him the bread for free
- When he stared at her in confusion, she shooed him out: *"Go on now, before you draw flies standing there gawking."*

## Impact on Rust
This brief interaction challenged everything the [[Organizations/Sisters of the Golden Erinyes|Sisters]] had taught him about how the world works. They'd taught him that:
- Charity was always conditional
- Kindness was a mask over cruelty
- People like him deserved nothing and should be grateful for scraps

Marta's gesture was none of those things. It was casual, almost dismissive—feeding a hungry kid because that's just what you do. No ceremony, no strings, no expectation of gratitude or transformation.

Rust sat outside the settlement for an hour trying to process which version of the world was real: the monastery's, or this.

## Current Status
Unknown. Presumably still running her shop in that small Kyonin settlement. She likely doesn't remember the encounter—just one of thousands of transactions over the years. But for Rust, it was foundational: the first piece of evidence that the Sisters were wrong about how people work.

## Motivations
- Running her business
- Taking care of her community
- Doing what needs doing without making it complicated

## Quote
*"Well, that bread's on the house then. You look like you need it more than I need the copper."*

*"Go on now, before you draw flies standing there gawking."*
