# Mika

## Overview
**Role:** Fellow orphan at the [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|Monastery]]  
**Organization:** [[Organizations/Sisters of the Golden Erinyes|Sisters of the Golden Erinyes]] (unwillingly)  
**Status:** Unknown  
**Age:** Younger than [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] (was a young girl when he escaped)

## Description
A small human girl with dark hair and too-thin features. Mika was one of the human orphans at the monastery, the child of a destitute family who couldn't afford to keep her. She cried during prayers, which earned her frequent punishments including being denied meals.

## Relationship to Rust
Mika represents one of the few moments where Rust acted against his survival instincts out of pure compassion. When she was denied food for crying during prayer, he risked himself to slip her an extra portion. [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] caught him, and the subsequent beating was the one that triggered [[Events/Rust's Awakening|his awakening]].

Rust doesn't know what happened to her after he escaped. This uncertainty weighs on himâ€"did she face additional punishment for his actions? Did she survive? Did the Sisters break her the way they tried to break him?

## Current Status
Unknown. Possibilities include:
- Still at the monastery, now grown
- Escaped like Rust (potential reunion hook)
- Fully indoctrinated into Asmodean doctrine
- Died during her time there
- Released and living an ordinary life

## Potential Plot Hooks
- Mika escaped years after Rust and is now searching for him
- She's become a Sister herself, a true believer, and sees finding Rust as redemption
- She's still at the monastery and needs rescue
- She's encountered the party separately and mentions a goblin who once helped her
- She died because of Rust's actions (guilt and complicated grief)

## Thematic Significance
Mika represents the cost of compassion and the uncertainty that haunts survivors. Rust helped her and suffered for it, then abandoned her by escaping. His guilt over leaving her behind is part of why he helps others now—he's trying to balance accounts that can never truly be balanced.

*In Rust's memories, she's always crying softly during evening prayers, trying so hard to be quiet enough that the Sisters won't notice. He wonders if she ever learned to stop crying, or if they broke that part of her.*
