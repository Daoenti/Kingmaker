# Animal Whisperer Background

## Game Mechanical Definition
**System:** Pathfinder 2nd Edition  
**Type:** Character Background (selected at 1st level)  
**Trained Skill:** Nature  
**Lore Skill:** Stabling Lore (or similar animal-related Lore)  
**Background Feat:** Train Animal (or similar animal-related skill feat)

## Standard Background Description
Animal Whisperers have developed an intuitive understanding of animal behavior through direct experience working with creatures. They might have been stable hands, shepherds, animal trainers, or wilderness guides. Some found companionship with beasts when people failed them.

## What This Grants at Level 1

### Mechanical Benefits
At 1st level, the Animal Whisperer background provides:

**Trained in Nature:** Proficiency in the Nature skill, used for:
- Identifying animals and their behavior
- Recalling knowledge about creatures
- Commanding or calming animals
- Understanding animal tracks and signs
- Surviving in wilderness by reading natural patterns

**Trained in Lore:** One specific Lore skill related to animals:
- For Rust: **Stabling Lore** (reflects his brief work as stable hand)

**Background Feat - Train Animal:** 
- Can attempt to teach animals simple tricks or tasks
- Makes animals more reliable and responsive
- Represents practical hands-on experience, not magical communication
- Requires time and patience (not instant)

### What It Is NOT at Level 1
At 1st level, Animal Whisperer does NOT provide:
- Magical communication with animals (requires spells)
- Automatic animal friendship or obedience
- An animal companion (requires class feature or feat)
- Supernatural abilities with creatures
- Expert or Master proficiency (comes with leveling)
- Years of professional experience

## Rust's Implementation at Level 1 (Age 13)

### One Year of Experience, Just Starting
Rust has been working with animals for **one year** during his wandering after escaping the monastery (age 12-13). This gives him:
- **Trained proficiency** in Nature (standard for level 1)
- **Basic competence** with common domestic animals
- **Natural aptitude** that's just emerging
- **Lots of room to grow**
- **Fresh perspective** and enthusiasm

At level 1 and age 13, he's:
- Just learning the fundamentals
- Making plenty of mistakes
- Building confidence gradually
- Discovering his natural affinity
- Still figuring things out

### How He Developed This Connection

**Timeline:**
- **Age 12 (escape):** Fled the monastery, scared and alone
- **First few months:** Discovered animals didn't judge him, felt safe around them
- **Ages 12-13:** Worked brief stints as stable hand, farm helper, learned by doing
- **Age 13 (present):** Has basic skills, natural talent, much to learn

**Key Factors:**
- **Shared Experience:** Recognized kinship with creatures deemed "lesser"
- **Non-Judgmental Acceptance:** Animals responded to kindness, not species or age
- **Practical Need:** Skills helped him find work and survive as a young goblin alone
- **Emotional Safety:** Animals provided companionship without complications
- **Natural Affinity:** Something about him puts animals at ease (unclear if mundane or related to his curse)

### Professional Experience (What He's Actually Done in One Year)

**Primary: Stable Hand (Most Experience)**
- Worked in 3-4 different towns over the past year
- Basic care: feeding, grooming, mucking stalls
- Simple handling: leading horses, basic commands
- Learned through observation and practice
- This is his strongest area but still developing

**Secondary: Farm Work (Several Weeks Total)**
- Helped with various livestock when needed
- Fed chickens, goats, pigs
- Basic herding with dogs
- Learned animals have individual personalities
- More exposure than expertise

**Tertiary: Wilderness Observation (Ongoing)**
- Camps in wild areas regularly (no money for inns)
- Watches animal behavior for survival
- Learns which creatures are dangerous, which are safe
- Uses animals to find water, predict weather
- Learning by necessity, not formal training

**Limited: Exotic Animals (Days, Not Weeks)**
- Brief encounter with traveling merchants' animals
- Fascinated but intimidated by unfamiliar creatures
- More questions than answers
- Inspired him to learn more

### Current Capabilities at Age 13, Level 1

**Comfortable With:**
- Horses (most experience, still basic level)
- Common farm animals (chickens, goats, pigs)
- Dogs (worked alongside them)
- Stable/barn environments
- Basic animal first aid

**Developing Skills With:**
- Wild animals (observation only, cautious approach)
- Reading animal body language
- Predicting animal reactions
- Training simple behaviors
- Building trust with nervous creatures

**Still Learning:**
- Riding (can stay on, not skilled)
- Complex training techniques
- Handling aggressive or injured animals safely
- Regional wildlife he hasn't encountered
- Professional-level husbandry

**No Experience With:**
- Magical beasts
- Exotic creatures
- Aquatic animals
- Flying creatures (beyond common birds)
- Anything truly dangerous

### The Connection - Mostly Mundane, Hints of More

**Primarily Natural Talent at Level 1:**
- Patient and calm demeanor (learned from trauma survival)
- Observant and careful (survival skills)
- Gentle touch and soft voice
- Willingness to work at animal pace
- Genuine empathy and kindness

**Subtle Hints of Something More:**
- Animals seem to calm around him faster than expected
- Occasionally senses animal emotions or discomfort
- Injured animals sometimes approach him
- His presence settles spooked creatures
- Even aggressive animals seem less hostile

**Unclear Origin:**
- Natural goblin affinity? (goblins often work with animals)
- His Life Oracle curse creating connection to living things?
- Something primordial that animals sense?
- Or simply a traumatized child finding the only beings who don't hurt him?

At 13, even Rust doesn't know. It mostly feels normal with occasional odd moments that make him wonder.

## Practical Applications at Level 1

### In Wilderness
- **Identify** common animals and tracks (trained skill)
- **Predict weather** by watching animal behavior (basic level)
- **Find water** by following wildlife (if he notices them)
- **Detect danger** from animal alarm behaviors (sometimes)
- **Avoid startling** creatures when moving carefully

### In Settlements
- **Find stable work** easily (has references from previous jobs)
- **Calm spooked horses** (Train Animal feat, still learning)
- **Basic care** for common livestock competently
- **Recognize** common illnesses or injuries
- **Make friends** with local animals (dogs, cats, barn animals)

### In Party Dynamics
- **Tend party mounts** adequately
- **Notice** when animals are acting strangely (alert to danger)
- **Try to negotiate** with animals to avoid combat (success not guaranteed)
- **Provide** basic survival guidance using nature signs
- **Show vulnerability** around creatures more than people

### Realistic Limitations at Level 1, Age 13
- Makes mistakes frequently (he's learning)
- Can be overwhelmed by unfamiliar situations
- Limited experience means limited confidence
- Dangerous animals still scare him
- Can't handle every animal situation
- Needs help with complex problems
- Still building his knowledge base

## Character Development Through Background

### Skills at Level 1
- **Nature (Trained):** Primary skill, room to grow to Expert and beyond
- **Stabling Lore (Trained):** Specialized but limited knowledge
- **Medicine (Trained separately):** Some veterinary knowledge applies
- **Survival (Untrained, uses Nature):** Learning through necessity
- **Animal Empathy (Untrained):** Natural talent, undeveloped

### Personality Traits Shaped by Animals
In just one year, working with animals has taught Rust:
- **Patience:** They can't be rushed or forced
- **Gentleness:** Kindness gets better results than cruelty (opposite of monastery)
- **Observation:** Reading subtle cues and body language
- **Trust:** Animals show him relationships don't have to hurt
- **Worth:** He's good at something, has value

### Philosophical Foundation (Just Beginning)
Animals are teaching Rust:
- Relationships can be based on respect, not fear
- Trust is earned through consistency and kindness
- Communication doesn't require words
- Simple care matters
- You can choose to be gentle despite experiencing cruelty

At 13, these are new ideas he's just starting to internalize.

## Integration with Oracle Class at Level 1

### Thematic Synergy
Life Oracle + Animal Whisperer creates compelling character:
- **Life force connection:** His curse involves primordial life energy, animals are pure life
- **Healing focus:** Practicing on animals before he's comfortable with people
- **Trust issues:** Animals are safer to care for than humans
- **Natural vs. divine:** His mundane skills contrast with supernatural curse
- **Growing together:** Both his oracle powers and animal skills are developing

### Mechanical Synergy at Level 1
- **Nature skill** for animal knowledge and handling
- **Life spells** work on animals as well as humanoids
- **Medicine skill** applies to creature healing
- **Curse manifestations** might involve animal reactions (animals sense his wrongness)
- **Combined approach:** Natural skills plus supernatural power

### Character Complexity
Creates interesting dynamics:
- Comfortable with animals, anxious with people
- Trusts his trained skills, suspicious of his oracle curse
- At ease in stables, tense in crowds
- Confident with creatures, uncertain with humanoids
- Simple relationships with animals, complicated with people

## RP Guidance for Level 1, Age 13

### Playing the Background Appropriately
**Do:**
- Show basic competence with common animals
- Make mistakes and learn from them
- Display natural talent that's still developing
- Use animals for comfort and emotional support
- Let animal interactions reveal his gentler side

**Don't:**
- Automatically succeed with all animals
- Act like a master trainer at 13
- Make it magical without actual magic
- Overshadow more experienced characters
- Forget he's still learning

### Rust-Specific Behaviors at Level 1
- **Cautious confidence:** Knows basics, uncertain about advanced situations
- **Practical application:** Uses skills for survival, not show
- **Emotional connection:** Animals are where he feels safe
- **Learning moments:** Makes mistakes, asks questions (rare for him)
- **Age-appropriate:** Sometimes acts like the kid he is around animals

### Character Growth Potential
As Rust levels and ages:
- **Level 5 (age 15-16):** Expert in Nature, significantly more skilled
- **Level 10 (age 17-18):** Possible animal companion, advanced training
- **Level 15 (age 20+):** Master-level understanding, near-supernatural ability
- **Level 20 (adult):** Legendary skills, potential magical aspects

His animal skills should grow alongside his oracle powers and maturity.

## DM Guidance for Level 1, Age 13

### Appropriate Challenges
- Domestic animals: Easy to Normal DC (his comfort zone)
- Wild animals (calm): Normal to Hard DC (less experience)
- Aggressive/injured animals: Hard to Very Hard DC (dangerous for him)
- Unfamiliar species: Hard DC (limited exposure)
- Magical beasts: Very Hard to Impossible DC (no experience)

### Using the Background in Play
**Early Campaign:**
- Let him succeed at basic animal tasks
- Create learning opportunities through failure
- Show animals providing emotional support
- Use his skills to help party occasionally
- Demonstrate he's competent but young

**Character Moments:**
- Animals reveal his vulnerability
- Success with creatures boosts confidence
- Failure teaches humility
- Party sees his gentleness
- NPCs react to young goblin's talent

**Plot Integration:**
- Stable work provides information/contacts
- Animals witness crimes/events
- His reputation spreads (talented young goblin)
- Former employers remember him
- Animals lead to adventure hooks

### Respecting Age and Level
At 13 and level 1, Rust should:
- Succeed at appropriate-level tasks
- Struggle with advanced challenges
- Need help with dangerous situations
- Show both competence and youth
- Have room to grow dramatically

## Timeline Corrections

### One Year Breakdown (Age 12-13)
**First 3 Months After Escape:**
- Survival mode, living rough
- Discovered animals were friendly
- First stable job (2-3 weeks)
- Learned absolute basics

**Months 4-8:**
- Several short-term stable positions
- Developed core skills
- Worked on a farm briefly
- Started feeling competent

**Months 9-12:**
- [[Events/Sevenarches Encounter|Sevenarches encounter]] (few months ago)
- Continued wandering and working
- Refined his skills
- Reached goblin adulthood (age 13)
- Current campaign start

### Experience Level Appropriate for Timeline
One year gives him:
- Basic competence, not mastery
- Trained proficiency (level appropriate)
- Practical skills, limited theory
- Recent discovery of talent
- Foundation for future growth

He's notably skilled for someone his age and experience, suggesting natural talent, but he's not a professional yet.

## Notes for Campaign

### Starting Point
Rust is at the **very beginning** of his journey:
- Just reached adulthood

*At 13, I've only been free for a year. I'm still figuring out who I am when no one's telling me. Animals help. They don't care that I'm young, or goblin, or cursed. They just care if I'm kind.* - Rust's current perspective
