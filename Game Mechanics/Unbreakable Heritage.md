# Unbreakable Heritage

## Official Game Mechanics

**System:** Pathfinder 2nd Edition
**Type:** Goblin Heritage
**Ancestry:** Goblin
**Level Requirement:** 1st (selected at character creation)
**Source:** [Player Core pg. 55](https://2e.aonprd.com/Heritages.aspx?ID=254)

### Mechanical Benefits

The Unbreakable goblin heritage provides the following benefits:

**Increased Hit Points:** You gain 10 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of 6. This represents your naturally resilient physiology from traits such as an exceptionally thick skull, cartilaginous bones, or some other mixed blessing.

**Reduced Falling Damage:** You reduce the falling damage you take as though you had fallen half the distance.

### Key Points
- This heritage is **static** - it doesn't scale or improve with level
- The benefits are **biological**, not magical or supernatural
- It represents natural physical toughness, not regeneration or healing

## What This Means for Rust

### Physical Manifestation
Rust's Unbreakable heritage manifests as exceptional physical durability:
- **Hit Points:** 20 HP at level 1 (8 Oracle + 10 Unbreakable ancestry + 2 Con modifier)
- **Tougher Body:** Thicker skull, denser bones, more resilient cartilage
- **Fall Resistance:** Can survive falls that would cripple others
- **Endurance:** Can take more punishment before going down
- **Observable:** People notice he's "tough for his size" but nothing supernatural

### How It Works
This is purely **biological resilience**:
- Thicker, denser bones don't break as easily
- Cartilaginous structures absorb impact better
- His body simply endures more punishment than normal
- No magic involved - just genetic good fortune
- Always active, can't be turned off or controlled

## Narrative Role

### At the Monastery
The Unbreakable heritage's main impact was during Rust's childhood:
- **Survival:** He survived beatings that killed or crippled other goblin children
- **Escalation:** [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] could hit him harder without killing him
- **Misinterpretation:** His survival was seen as "defiance" rather than "durability"
- **Final Beating:** His toughness bought him time for his oracle power to awaken
- **Survivor's Guilt:** He outlasted frailer children, which haunts him

### The Awakening Event
On the night of [[Events/Rust's Awakening|Rust's awakening]]:
- His Unbreakable heritage **kept him alive** at death's door
- His extra HP and physical toughness prevented instant death
- This gave his **Life Oracle mystery time to manifest**
- The oracle power provided the actual healing that saved him
- **Heritage bought time; oracle saved his life**

### Relationship to Oracle Powers
These are **separate and distinct**:
- **Unbreakable:** Genetic, biological, inherited at birth
- **Life Oracle:** Mystical curse, manifested at age 12
- **Not connected in source**, just complementary in function
- Being Unbreakable didn't cause the oracle curse
- The curse didn't make him Unbreakable

They work together thematically:
- **Heritage:** Personal durability - he can take hits
- **Mystery:** Healing others - he can restore life
- **Combined:** He endures so he can help others endure
- **Irony:** He's tough but the Life curse penalizes healing himself

## Gameplay Implications

### Combat Balance
At level 1, Rust is:
- **Tougher than average:** 20 HP vs. typical 15-16 for Small casters
- **Fall resistant:** Better at surviving environmental hazards
- **Still mortal:** Subject to normal damage, conditions, death effects
- **Not overpowered:** The +4 HP provides a modest safety margin

### Tactical Use
Rust uses his durability strategically:
- Takes point position because he can absorb hits
- Willing to risk dangerous climbs or falls
- Protects frailer party members by intercepting attacks
- Doesn't fear physical confrontation as much as others
- Knows his limits but pushes them when necessary

### No Progression
Unlike oracle powers, this heritage is **constant**:
- Always 10 HP from ancestry (not 6)
- Always halves falling damage
- No additional benefits at higher levels
- Doesn't scale or improve
- This is what he **is**, not what he's **becoming**

## Thematic Significance

### Matter-of-Fact Acceptance
Rust's relationship with being Unbreakable is practical:
- It's just part of who he is physically
- He's known his whole life he was tougher than other goblin children
- Doesn't think about it much - like having two eyes or ten fingers
- Uses it tactically without moral qualms
- No shame or pride attached - just biology

### Survivor's Burden
The trait carries psychological weight:
- He survived when frailer children didn't
- Sister Velenne beat him harder because he "could take it"
- His toughness made him a better target for sustained abuse
- Outlasting others creates guilt, not triumph

### Character Focus
The **Life Oracle mystery** is the interesting story:
- The heritage is static biology - no mystery to uncover
- The oracle curse is mysterious, growing, and supernatural
- Story focus should be on understanding his curse
- His tough bones are a tool, not a narrative driver

*Being tougher than most just means you can take more hits before you go down. It doesn't mean you won't go down eventually.* - Rust's practical view
