# River Kingdoms

## Overview
**Type:** Region of independent kingdoms
**Location:** Central Avistan, east of [[Locations/Druma|Druma]]
**Government:** None unified; dozens of small kingdoms, republics, and city-states
**Alignment:** Mixed, predominantly Chaotic
**Notable Features:** Constant border changes, freedom, lawlessness, opportunity
**Primary Geography:** River valleys and plains

## Description
The River Kingdoms isn't a nation—it's a region of dozens (the number changes monthly) of independent polities along the Sellen River and its tributaries. Borders shift constantly, rulers rise and fall, and the only constant is change itself.

It's a land of opportunity and danger, where anyone can carve out a kingdom if they're strong, clever, or lucky enough. It's also where kingdoms collapse overnight, where banditry is a career path, and where the phrase "six river freedoms" matters more than any law.

## The Six River Freedoms

The River Kingdoms share these principles:
1. **Say What You Will** - Freedom of speech
2. **Oath What You Must** - Make only promises you choose
3. **Earn What You Can** - Keep what you take/make
4. **Trade What You Want** - No restrictions on commerce
5. **Worship as You Will** - Religious freedom
6. **Kill Who You Must** - Self-defense and dueling accepted

These aren't laws—they're shared values. Most kingdoms respect them. Most.

## Geography

- Sellen River and major tributaries

---
*The River Kingdoms are chaos given geography—dozens of would-be rulers fighting over territory that redraws itself monthly. No laws except what you enforce, no peace except what you make, no future except what you build. For someone like [[Characters/Rust|Rust]], who spent ten years under absolute control, the freedom might be intoxicating. Or terrifying. Or both. The River Kingdoms don't care what you were—only what you can do. They're also right next to [[Locations/Sevenarches|Sevenarches]], where Rust learned there are truths worse than tyranny. So the question isn't whether the River Kingdoms would accept him. It's whether he can accept what living near that forest means. Freedom to build a future. Proximity to a past he can't escape. Maybe that's fitting. Maybe that's exactly where his story needs to go.*
