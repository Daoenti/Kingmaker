 Awakening|Rust's awakening]] occurred. A windowless stone room in the monastery's basement, equipped with restraints, various implements of punishment, and a single locked door. The walls are bare stone, stained with old blood that's never quite scrubbed away. A small drain in the floor's center tells its own story.

The room is soundproofed by design and thick stone. No one hears what happens there except the Sister administering correction and the child being corrected.

### The Record Vault
[[NPCs/Sister Malhana|Sister Malhana]]'s pride: complete documentation of every child processed through the monastery. Names (given and taken), intake dates, correction schedules, progress notes, final dispositions. Meticulously organized, potentially damning if exposed, but legally protected as religious records.

Could contain information about [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s origins, other escaped orphans, or patterns of abuse spanning years.

### The Garden
One of the few areas with sunlight and growing things. Ironically, this is where many children first feel hope, tending plants that grow despite harsh conditions. The Sisters allow this small mercy because even they understand that completely broken subjects are useless.

## Security
- High stone walls, 15 feet tall
- Single main gate, always guarded
- Windows are narrow slits, barred
- Children's quarters locked from outside at night
- Guards are Hellknight-trained, efficient and cruel
- Magical wards against scrying (protecting "privacy" of their methods)

## Inhabitants

### The Sisters
Approximately 20-30 sisters of varying ranks, all committed to the institution's doctrine. They rotate through roles: some handle administration, some education, some discipline. All are complicit.

### The Guards
6-8 professional guards, mostly former Hellknights or similar military background. Paid well to ask no questions and prevent escapes.

### The Orphans
Population varies between 40-60 at any given time. Mix of goblinoid war orphans and human children from destitute or abusive families. Ages range from toddlers to teenagers.

### Support Staff
Minimal. Most labor is done by older orphans. A few hired positions for specialized work the Sisters won't dirty their hands with.

## Escape Difficulty
**Extreme.** Most children never try—they're too broken, too young, or too convinced the outside world is worse. Of those who try:
- Most are caught within hours
- Punishments are severe enough to deter future attempts
- Few have anywhere to go even if they succeed
- The monastery's reputation means locals return runaways

[[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s escape succeeded through combination of:
- Timing (during morning chaos after his night of healing)
- Desperation (knowing they'd never release him now)
- Luck (no one expected a half-dead goblin to be capable of running)
- Supernatural resilience (his curse kept him moving when he should have collapsed)

## Legal Status
Fully legitimate religious institution. They have:
- Official sanction from Isger's government
- Tax-exempt status as charitable organization
- Legal guardianship of all orphans
- Protection under religious freedom laws
- Backing from powerful Asmodean interests

Investigating them legally is nearly impossible. They're protected by layers of bureaucracy, religious law, and powerful patrons who benefit from their existence.

## Current Status
Operating normally as far as [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] knows. He's been gone for years, and the monastery continues its work, processing new children, breaking them, and sending them out into the world as obedient servants.

Whether [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] still seeks him specifically or has moved on to new projects is unknown. Whether [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]] still suffers there is unknown. The monastery simply continues, grinding children into useful shapes.

## Plot Hooks

### Investigation
- Party hired to investigate rumors of abuse
- Former victim seeking evidence for legal case
- Hellknight reformist wants to expose corrupt affiliates
- Missing persons case leads here

### Rescue
- Current orphan manages to get message out
- [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]] or another of [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s contemporaries is still there
- Party member discovers relative was sent here
- Time-sensitive rescue before child is "transferred"

### Information
- Records vault contains crucial information about character backstories
- Evidence needed for larger case against Asmodean corruption
- Tracking other "graduates" who've become problems elsewhere
- [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] needs to know his true origins

### Confrontation
- [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] has found [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s trail
- Party must defend refuge where former victims gather
- Sisters expanding operations, need to be stopped
- [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] decides he's done running

## Dangers
**Social:** Legally protected, attacking them has consequences  
**Psychological:** Confronting this place will traumatize [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] and potentially other party members  
**Physical:** Well-defended, guards are competent, Sisters have divine magic  
**Magical:** Wards, protective spells, potential Hellknight backup

## Potential Allies
- Other escaped victims
- Reformist Hellknights disgusted by affiliation
- Local clergy of non-Asmodean faiths
- Isger officials who've wanted evidence for years
- [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]], if she survived and escaped

## DM Notes
This location represents institutional evil—banal, legal, systematic. Use it sparingly and with care. Consider:

- Session zero discussion about abuse content
- Allowing [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s player agency in how deeply to engage
- Not making the Sisters cartoonishly evil—their mundane certainty is worse
- Showing consequences of confronting them (legal, social, psychological)
- Possibility of bittersweet victory (freeing current orphans but not undoing past harm)

The monastery should feel like a real place that exists independent of [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s story. Other victims, other perpetrators, ongoing operations. The party can damage it but likely can't eliminate it entirely without significant resources and allies.
