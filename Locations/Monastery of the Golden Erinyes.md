# Monastery of the Golden Erinyes

## Overview
**Type:** Asmodean monastery and "orphanage"
**Location:** Western [[Locations/Isger|Isger]], remote countryside
**Operated By:** [[Organizations/Sisters of the Golden Erinyes|Sisters of the Golden Erinyes]]
**Founded:** Shortly after the [[Events/Goblinblood Wars|Goblinblood Wars]] (early 4700s AR)
**Purpose:** Ostensibly civilizing orphans; actually systematic abuse disguised as education
**Status:** Active and operating

## Description
The Monastery of the Golden Erinyes sits in the remote western hills of [[Locations/Isger|Isger]], isolated from major settlements by design. It's a fortress-like structure of dark stone, built in the austere Asmodean architectural style—all sharp angles, minimal ornamentation, and an oppressive sense of order.

The monastery presents itself as a charitable institution saving orphaned children from the chaos of post-war [[Locations/Isger|Isger]]. In reality, it's a systematic operation for breaking children's wills and reforming them into obedient servants through theological justification of abuse.

This is where [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] spent ages 2-12, where his earliest conscious memories were formed, and where [[Events/Rust's Awakening|his awakening]] occurred.

## Architecture and Layout

### Exterior
- High stone walls (15 feet) surrounding the compound
- Single main gate, iron-bound and heavily reinforced
- Watchtowers at corners manned by guards
- Minimal windows, all narrow and barred
- The whole structure designed to keep people in, not out

### Main Hall
Large central chamber for communal prayers, meals, and indoctrination. Decorated with Asmodean iconography and quotes from scripture emphasizing obedience, hierarchy, and the virtue of suffering. Children spend hours here daily in enforced silence.

### Dormitories
Separate wings for different age groups and species. Spartan accommodations: stone floors, thin pallets, minimal heat. Locked from outside at night. Designed for efficient supervision and minimal comfort.

### Classroom Chambers
Where theological "education" occurs. Lessons focus on Asmodean doctrine, the divine nature of hierarchy, the virtue of obedience, and the wickedness of the children's natures. Physically uncomfortable by design—hard benches, poor lighting, cold rooms.

### Sister Velenne's Office
Where [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] conducts private "counseling sessions." Contains scripture books, discipline implements displayed on the walls like tools of a trade, and detailed records of each child's corrections. The room smells of old leather and fear.

### The Discipline Chamber
The room where [[Events/Rust's Awakening|Rust's awakening]] occurred. A windowless stone room in the monastery's basement, equipped with restraints, various implements of punishment, and a single locked door. The walls are bare stone, stained with old blood that's never quite scrubbed away. A small drain in the floor's center tells its own story.

The room is soundproofed by design and thick stone. No one hears what happens there except the Sister administering correction and the child being corrected.

### The Record Vault
[[NPCs/Sister Malhana|Sister Malhana]]'s pride: complete documentation of every child processed through the monastery. Names (given and taken), intake dates, correction schedules, progress notes, final dispositions. Meticulously organized, potentially damning if exposed, but legally protected as religious records.

Could contain information about [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s origins, other escaped orphans, or patterns of abuse spanning years.

### The Garden
One of the few areas with sunlight and growing things. Ironically, this is where many children first feel hope, tending plants that grow despite harsh conditions. The Sisters allow this small mercy because even they understand that completely broken subjects are useless.

## Security
- High stone walls, 15 feet tall
- Single main gate, always guarded
- Windows are narrow slits, barred
- Children's quarters locked from outside at night
- Guards are Hellknight-trained, efficient and cruel
- Magical wards against scrying (protecting "privacy" of their methods)

## Inhabitants

### The Sisters
Approximately 20-30 sisters of varying ranks, all committed to the institution's doctrine. They rotate through roles: some handle administration, some education, some discipline. All are complicit.

### The Guards
6-8 professional guards, mostly former Hellknights or similar military background. Paid well to ask no questions and prevent escapes.

### The Orphans
Population varies between 40-60 at any given time. Mix of goblinoid war orphans and human children from destitute or abusive families. Ages range from toddlers to teenagers.

### Support Staff
Minimal. Most labor is done by older orphans. A few hired positions for specialized work the Sisters won't dirty their hands with.

## Escape Difficulty
**Extreme.** Most children never try—they're too broken, too young, or too convinced the outside world is worse. Of those who try:
- Most are caught within hours
- Punishments are severe enough to deter future attempts
- Few have anywhere to go even if they succeed
- The monastery's reputation means locals return runaways

[[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s escape succeeded through combination of:
- Timing (during morning chaos after his night of healing)
- Desperation (knowing they'd never release him now)
- Luck (no one expected a half-dead goblin to be capable of running)
- Supernatural resilience (his curse kept him moving when he should have collapsed)

## Legal Status
Fully legitimate religious institution. They have:
- Official sanction from Isger's government
- Tax-exempt status as charitable organization
- Legal guardianship of all orphans
- Protection under religious freedom laws
- Backing from powerful Asmodean interests

Investigating them legally is nearly impossible. They're protected by layers of bureaucracy, religious law, and powerful patrons who benefit from their existence.

## Current Status
Operating normally as far as [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] knows. He's been gone a year, and the monastery continues its work, processing new children, breaking them, and sending them out into the world as obedient servants.

Whether [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] still seeks him specifically or has moved on to new projects is unknown. Whether [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]] still suffers there is unknown. The monastery simply continues, grinding children into useful shapes.

## Plot Hooks

### Investigation
- Party hired to investigate rumors of abuse
- Former victim seeking evidence for legal case
- Hellknight reformist wants to expose corrupt affiliates
- Missing persons case leads here

### Rescue
- Current orphan manages to get message out
- [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]] or another of [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s contemporaries is still there
- Party member discovers relative was sent here
- Time-sensitive rescue before child is "transferred"

### Information
- Records vault contains crucial information about character backstories
- Evidence needed for larger case against Asmodean corruption
- Tracking other "graduates" who've become problems elsewhere
- [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] needs to know his true origins

### Confrontation
- [[NPCs/Sister Velenne|Sister Velenne]] has found [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s trail
- Party must defend refuge where former victims gather
- Sisters expanding operations, need to be stopped
- [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] decides he's done running

## Dangers
**Social:** Legally protected, attacking them has consequences
**Psychological:** Confronting this place will traumatize [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] and potentially other party members
**Physical:** Well-defended, guards are competent, Sisters have divine magic
**Magical:** Wards, protective spells, potential Hellknight backup

## Potential Allies
- Other escaped victims
- Reformist Hellknights disgusted by affiliation
- Local clergy of non-Asmodean faiths
- Isger officials who've wanted evidence for years
- [[NPCs/Mika|Mika]], if she survived and escaped

*The sign above the gate reads: "Salvation Through Submission, Order Through Obedience." Most who pass beneath it are too young to read it. By the time they can, they believe it.*
