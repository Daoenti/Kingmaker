# Isger

## Overview
**Region:** Inner Sea, southern Avistan  
**Government:** Vassal state of Cheliax  
**Capital:** Elidir  
**Status:** Recovering from [[Events/Goblinblood Wars|Goblinblood Wars]]  
**Population:** Mixed, war-depleted

## Relevance to Rust
[[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s earliest memories are of burning goblin settlements in Isger during the tail end of the Goblinblood Wars. He was found as a toddler in the wreckage of a razed encampment, one of countless goblinoid orphans created by the conflict.

The [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|Monastery of the Golden Erinyes]] operates in western Isger, taking advantage of post-war chaos and the abundance of unwanted children to pursue their "civilizing" mission.

## Post-War Conditions
Isger is still recovering from the devastation of the Goblinblood Wars. The conflict left:
- Destroyed settlements
- Orphaned children (both goblin and human)
- Economic hardship
- Increased Hellknight and Asmodean influence
- Social tension between species

This environment allowed institutions like the [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|monastery]] to flourish under the guise of bringing order to chaos.

## Connection to Other Locations
- **South:** [[Locations/Cheliax|Cheliax]] (ruling power)
- **North:** [[Locations/Druma|Druma]] (where [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] traveled after escaping)
- **West:** Borders eventually leading toward River Kingdoms

*A land still haunted by recent war, where unwanted children are common and those who promise to "civilize" them are welcomed without too many questions.*
