# Cheliax

## Overview

**Type:** Nation/Empire
**Region:** Inner Sea, western Avistan
**Government:** Diabolical Empire ruled by House Thrune
**Alignment:** Lawful Evil
**Capital:** Egorian
**State Religion:** [[Deities/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]] (mandatory worship)
**Notable Features:** Hellknight orders, contract law, state-sanctioned devil binding

## Description
Cheliax is a once-great empire now ruled by diabolists who worship [[Deities/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]] as the state deity. After a civil war, House Thrune seized power through pacts with Hell itself, establishing a totalitarian regime where law and order are maintained through fear, contracts, and infernal magic.

The nation exemplifies Asmodean philosophy in practice: absolute hierarchy, tyranny disguised as order, and the belief that slavery and subjugation serve divine purpose. Citizens are bound by countless laws and contracts, with Hellknights enforcing order brutally and efficiently.

## Government and Society

### House Thrune
The ruling house maintains power through:
- Pacts with archdevils
- Mastery of contract law
- Control of Hellknight orders
- Mandatory worship of Asmodeus
- Network of informants and secret police

### Social Structure
Chelaxian society is rigidly hierarchical:
- **Nobility:** Diabolists and those with infernal connections
- **Citizens:** Free but heavily controlled population
- **Slaves:** Legal and common, including contract-bound servants
- **Non-humans:** Generally viewed as inferior or property

### Law and Order
Chelaxian law is absolute:
- Contract law supersedes morality
- Hellknights enforce order ruthlessly
- Dissent equals treason
- Devil binding is legal and practiced
- Slavery is institutionalized

## Religion and Philosophy

### State Religion
[[Deities/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]] worship is mandatory:
- Temples in every settlement
- Prayers required at schools and workplaces
- Religious institutions wield political power
- Heresy is punishable by death or worse
- Other faiths suppressed or banned

### Asmodean Doctrine in Practice
Chelaxian culture embodies Asmodean principles:
- Order through control and fear
- Hierarchy as natural and divine
- Suffering as instructive
- Power justifies itself
- Mercy is weakness

### Hellknights
Multiple orders operate throughout empire:
- Enforce law without mercy
- Technically separate from church
- Often more feared than loved
- Serve order above all else
- Some operate outside Cheliax

## Relationship to [[Locations/Isger|Isger]]

### Vassal State
[[Locations/Isger|Isger]] is a Chelaxian vassal:
- Conquered and absorbed decades ago
- Governed by Chelaxian appointees
- Required to enforce Chelaxian law
- Economic tributary to Cheliax
- Military support required on demand

### Cultural Influence
Cheliax shapes Isgeri culture:
- Asmodean worship spreading
- Legal system imposed
- Educational institutions follow Chelaxian model
- [[Organizations/Sisters of the Golden Erinyes|Sisters]] and similar orders operate freely
- Resistance movements face Hellknight repression

### Economic Exploitation
Cheliax extracts wealth from Isger:
- Taxes and tributes
- Resource extraction
- Trade controlled by Chelaxian merchants
- [[Events/Goblinblood Wars|Goblinblood Wars]] served Chelaxian interests
- Recovery deliberately slowed to maintain control

## Relevance to [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]

### Indirect Oppressor
Though Rust never lived in Cheliax proper, Chelaxian influence shaped his life:
- [[Organizations/Sisters of the Golden Erinyes|Sisters]] follow Chelaxian Asmodean doctrine
- [[Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes|Monastery]] operates under Chelaxian philosophy
- [[Events/Goblinblood Wars|Goblinblood Wars]] reflected Chelaxian racial policies
- His abuse was justified by Chelaxian theology
- His status as goblin reflects Chelaxian view of non-humans

### Potential Threat
As Rust grows older:
- His escape from monastery could draw attention
- Chelaxian authorities might view him as escaped property
- His oracle powers could attract wrong kind of interest
- His knowledge of Asmodean doctrine makes him dangerous witness
- His very existence challenges their philosophy

### Symbol of Resistance
Rust represents everything Cheliax claims impossible:
- Non-human achieving agency
- Escaped slave surviving and thriving
- Rejection of Asmodean order
- Proof that breaking is not salvation
- Evidence that their system fails

---
*Cheliax is the heart of Asmodean tyranny made manifest—a nation where law has no mercy, where slavery is divine order, where suffering is holy instruction. Rust never set foot in Cheliax proper, but he lived under its shadow his entire childhood. Every beating justified by Chelaxian theology. Every moment of abuse sanctioned by Chelaxian law. Every lesson he rejected was one Cheliax insisted was truth. He's proof that their perfect system fails. That their absolute order can be resisted. That breaking people doesn't save them—it just breaks them. And sometimes, the broken ones escape.*
