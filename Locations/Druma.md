# Druma

## Overview

**Type:** Nation/Plutocracy
**Region:** Inner Sea, central Avistan
**Government:** Merchant plutocracy ruled by the Resplendent Bureaucracy
**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
**Capital:** Kerse
**Ruler:** High Prophet of Abadar and Resplendent Bureaucracy
**State Religion:** Abadar (god of cities, wealth, law)
**Notable Features:** Wealth-based citizenship, mercenary armies, religious capitalism

## Description
Druma is a nation where wealth equals power, law is sacred, and commerce is religion. Ruled by the Resplendent Bureaucracy—a council of the wealthiest merchants and bankers—Druma exemplifies a society where gold determines citizenship, rights, and social standing.

Unlike [[Locations/Cheliax|Cheliax]]'s tyranny through fear or [[Locations/Kyonin|Kyonin]]'s isolation, Druma's philosophy is simple: money talks, and everything is for sale. This makes it simultaneously practical and cold, prosperous and heartless.

## Geography

### Central Location
Druma occupies strategic position:
- **North:** Five Kings Mountains
- **South:** [[Locations/Isger|Isger]] (where [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] came from)
- **East:** Lands toward River Kingdoms
- **West:** Toward coast
- Central Avistan trade routes pass through

### Major Cities

**Kerse (Capital):**
- Gleaming city of marble and gold
- Grand Temple of Abadar dominates skyline
- Banks and counting houses everywhere
- Spotlessly clean and rigidly organized
- Wealth on display at every corner

**Detmer:**
- Port city on Lake Encarthan
- Major trade hub
- Diverse population
- Where many travelers enter Druma
- Slightly less rigid than interior

**Macridi:**
- Manufacturing center
- Guild city
- More working class
- Still expensive by other standards
- Where goods are made rather than just traded

### Terrain
Druma's landscape includes:
- Fertile farmlands (all efficiently managed)
- Well-maintained roads (tolls required)
- Planned forests (for timber profit)
- Mining operations (properly licensed)
- Everything organized for profit

## Government and Society

### The Resplendent Bureaucracy
Druma is ruled by wealthy elite:
- Council of richest merchants and bankers
- High Prophet of Abadar holds religious authority
- Wealth literally buys political power
- Regular citizens have no vote
- Meritocracy where merit is measured in gold

### Citizenship Tiers
Social status depends on wealth:

**Prophet-Shepherds (Prophets):**
- Wealthiest citizens
- Full political rights
- Can hold office and vote
- Own most land and businesses
- Exempt from many laws

**Citizens:**
- Meet minimum wealth requirement
- Protected by law
- Can own property
- Pay lower taxes
- Middle class and skilled workers

**Free Laborers:**
- Below wealth threshold
- Limited legal protections
- Cannot own land in cities
- Subject to additional taxes
- Most of population
- Where [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] would fall

**Indebted:**
- Owe money to Prophets or state
- Essentially bound servants
- Cannot leave until debt paid
- Legal but criticized slavery
- Easy to fall into, hard to escape

### Law and Order

**The Law is Clear:**
- Everything codified and written
- Contracts are sacred
- Property rights absolute
- Violation means fines or debt servitude
- Justice is blind but expensive

**Mercenary Military:**
- Druma has no standing army
- Hires mercenaries as needed
- "Blackjackets" are permanent city guard
- Everything funded through careful budgeting
- Defense by cost-benefit analysis

## Religion and Philosophy

### Abadar Worship
State religion centers on Abadar:
- God of cities, wealth, merchants, law
- Worship through commerce and fair dealing
- Temples double as banks
- Priests are accountants and judges
- Prosperity is holiness

### Religious Capitalism
Druman philosophy combines faith and finance:
- Wealth creation is moral good
- Poverty is personal failure
- Charity undermines self-reliance
- Everything has price, including salvation
- Contracts are more sacred than oaths

### Practical Approach
Unlike [[Locations/Cheliax|Cheliax]] or [[Locations/Kyonin|Kyonin]]:
- No inherent racism (money is colorblind)
- Welcome anyone who can pay
- Judge by wealth, not species
- Practical rather than ideological
- Cold rather than cruel

## Trade and Economy

### Economic Powerhouse
Druma is extremely wealthy:
- Controls major trade routes
- Banking system throughout Inner Sea
- Manufacturing base
- Agricultural surplus
- Loans to other nations

### Currency Standard
The Druman platinum piece:
- Called "Prophets"
- High-value currency
- Trusted throughout region
- Backed by Druma's stability
- Symbol of their economic power

### Trade Policy
Druma practices:
- Free trade (with appropriate tariffs)
- Property rights strictly enforced
- Contract law sophisticated and binding
- No embargoes or ideological restrictions
- Business with anyone who pays

## Attitude Toward Non-Humans

### Officially Indifferent
Druma's position is unusual:
- Species doesn't matter, wealth does
- Poor elf has fewer rights than rich goblin
- Technically no discrimination
- Practically, most non-humans are poor
- [[Characters/Rust|Rust]] experienced this firsthand

### Practical Reality
In practice this means:
- Non-humans CAN succeed if wealthy
- But start with disadvantages elsewhere
- Treated fairly once they prove wealth
- Until then, just more poor laborers
- Better than [[Locations/Cheliax|Cheliax]], worse than they claim

## [[Characters/Rust|Rust]]'s Time in Druma

### Brief Passage North
After escaping [[Locations/Isger|Isger]], Rust traveled through Druma:
- Worked odd jobs for food and shelter
- Stable work when he could find it
- Healed animals for pay
- Learned that everything costs
- Experienced being judged by poverty rather than species

### What He Learned
Druma taught Rust:
- Not all law is tyranny (but all costs)
- Practicality can be cold comfort
- Fair treatment still requires payment
- Being goblin mattered less than being poor
- Different cruelty than monastery, still cruelty

### Why He Kept Moving
Rust didn't stay because:
- No money to meet citizenship requirements
- Work was temporary and low-paying
- Too expensive to settle
- Still running from past
- Seeking answers elsewhere
- Druma valued what he didn't have

### Key Encounters
During his time in Druma:
- Found work more easily than in [[Locations/Isger|Isger]]
- Paid fairly but minimally
- Learned about contract law (helpful later)
- Saved just enough to keep moving
- Met traveling merchants and workers
- Heard about lands further north

## Military and Defense

### Mercenary System
Druma's unique military:
- No standing army
- Hire mercenaries when needed
- Keep detailed cost analyses
- Only fight when profitable
- Prefer to buy peace

### The Blackjackets
Permanent city guard force:
- Well-paid professionals
- Enforce law without bias (against poor)
- Efficient and effective
- Not cruel, just businesslike
- Respected but not loved

### Defense Strategy
Druma protects itself through:
- Economic relationships (war is bad for business)
- Paying others to fight
- Well-maintained fortifications
- Intelligence networks
- Making conquest unprofitable

## Relationship to Neighbors

### With [[Locations/Cheliax|Cheliax]]

*Druma judges you by your gold, not your species. For Rust, that was... different. Not better, necessarily. Being poor in Druma meant being nobody, but at least being goblin was optional. He worked stables for copper pieces, slept in barns, moved north when he had enough saved. Druma was fair—if you could pay for fairness. If you couldn't, well, that was your problem. It wasn't [[Locations/Cheliax|Chelaxian]] cruelty. It wasn't [[Locations/Kyonin|Kyonin]] exclusion. It was just... indifference. Cold, practical indifference. Sometimes that's better. Sometimes it's just a different kind of lonely.*
