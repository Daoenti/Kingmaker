            <h1 id="the-gift-and-the-curse-age-5">The Gift and the Curse: Age 5</h1>
<p><em>Content Warning: This narrative deals with the exploitation of a child's intelligence, the weaponization of education, and the moment when survival and visibility become impossible to separate.</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-day-everything-changed">The Day Everything Changed</h2>
<p>There are days that divide a life into before and after. For <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a>, age five, this was one of them.</p>
<p>The day began like any other. The bell at 5 AM. The scramble to dress. The morning prayers with aching knees. The inadequate breakfast. The familiar litany of discomfort and obedience that defined his existence.</p>
<p>But that day, after morning work, <a href="/Kingmaker/NPCs/Sister Malhana.html">Sister Malhana</a> announced that the children would be tested.</p>
<p>"We will assess your progress," she said, voice flat and administrative. "Those who demonstrate capacity will receive advanced instruction. Those who do not will continue as they are."</p>
<p>The human children straightened, eager to prove themselves. Advanced instruction meant warmer dormitories, better food, reduced manual labor. It meant being seen as worthy of investment rather than just another mouth to feed.</p>
<p>Rust kept his head down. The test wasn't for him. He was the goblin. He existed to work, not to learn. His capacity was irrelevant.</p>
<p>But Sister Malhana called the children alphabetically, and somehow, "Rust" ended up on her list.</p>
<h2 id="the-test">The Test</h2>
<p>The testing room was small, lit by a single window. Sister Malhana sat at a heavy desk, ledger open, pen ready. One by one, she called the children in.</p>
<p>When Rust's turn came, he entered with the same wariness he brought to everything. Waiting for the trap, the trick, the punishment he didn't yet know he'd earned.</p>
<p>"Sit," she commanded.</p>
<p>He sat. The chair was too large for him; his feet didn't reach the floor.</p>
<p>She placed a book in front of him. Thick, leather-bound, text in Common. The pages were worn from use, the words small and densely packed.</p>
<p>"Read," she said.</p>
<p>Rust stared at the page. He recognized some letter shapes from seeing them on chapel walls, from watching other children's lessons. But he'd never been taught to read. Why would they teach the goblin to read?</p>
<p>"I don't—" he began.</p>
<p>"Read," she repeated, voice sharp. "Or admit you cannot and return to work."</p>
<p>He looked at the page again. The shapes that were letters. The patterns they made.</p>
<p>And something in his mind... clicked.</p>
<p>He couldn't have explained it then or even now, at thirteen. But in that moment, looking at those symbols, his brain made connections. Letter shapes became sounds. Sounds became words. Words became meaning.</p>
<p>He began to read.</p>
<h2 id="the-awakening-of-understanding">The Awakening of Understanding</h2>
<p>The passage was from an Asmodean theological text—something about the divine order of hierarchy, how those of lesser race must submit to the natural authority of their betters.</p>
<p>Rust read it aloud, his small voice careful and precise:</p>
<p><em>"The inferior species, created by divine will to serve their natural superiors, must accept their station with gratitude. To resist one's ordained place is to resist the fundamental order of creation itself. The goblinoid races, being of diminished capacity and savage nature, exist to demonstrate the mercy of civilization through their subjugation."</em></p>
<p>The words hurt to say. Even at five, even reading for the first time, he understood what the text was claiming about him. About his people. About his fundamental worthlessness.</p>
<p>But he kept reading. Through the pain, through the recognition, through the bitter irony that his first act of literacy was reading justification for his own oppression.</p>
<p>When he finished the passage, silence filled the room.</p>
<p>Sister Malhana stared at him. Her pen had stopped moving. For the first time in his memory of her, she looked surprised.</p>
<p>"Read that again," she said slowly.</p>
<p>He did. Flawlessly. The words came easier the second time, his brain cementing the patterns, building pathways.</p>
<p>"You've been taught to read," she said, though it was barely a question. She was already reviewing her own records, searching for the lesson she'd forgotten authorizing.</p>
<p>"No, Sister," Rust said quietly. "This is my first time."</p>
<p>Another long silence.</p>
<p>Then she opened her ledger and made a notation, pen scratching across parchment with the same methodical precision she used for everything:</p>
<p><em>"Subject demonstrates exceptional literacy capacity. Learned reading during initial test. Recommend advanced instruction despite racial limitations. Intelligence could prove useful."</em></p>
<p>She closed the book. Looked at him with those cold, calculating eyes.</p>
<p>"You will attend afternoon lessons with the human children," she said. "You will learn to write, to cipher, to read theological texts. This is not mercy. This is investment. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Sister," he said, because what else could he say?</p>
<p>"You may go."</p>
<p>He left. Returned to work. But everything had changed.</p>
<p>He'd been seen. His intelligence had been noticed. And he already knew, with the instinct of a prey animal, that being noticed was dangerous.</p>
<h2 id="the-gift">The Gift</h2>
<p>From that day forward, <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a> attended afternoon lessons.</p>
<p>The classroom was cramped, rows of benches where human orphans aged 6-12 studied reading, writing, arithmetic, history, and theology. He was the youngest. He was the only goblin. He was given a bench at the back, isolated from the others.</p>
<p>But he was there.</p>
<p><strong>Reading</strong> came naturally, almost frighteningly so. Within weeks, he was reading texts the older children struggled with. His brain seemed hungry for written words, devouring everything placed in front of him. Religious texts, histories, even the occasional bit of practical writing—he absorbed it all.</p>
<p><strong>Writing</strong> was harder. His small hands struggled with the pen, and the Sisters demanded absolute precision. Every letter had to be formed exactly right. His early attempts were covered in corrections, annotations in harsh red ink marking every flaw.</p>
<p>But he practiced. On scraps of paper he wasn't supposed to have. With stolen pencil stubs. He practiced until his handwriting was neat and precise and absolutely perfect—because anything less meant punishment.</p>
<p><strong>Arithmetic</strong> was logical, systematic. Numbers followed rules that made sense, unlike the arbitrary cruelty of daily life. He excelled at calculations, found comfort in the certainty of mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong> was propaganda. He learned about the Goblinblood Wars as "necessary operations to pacify savage populations." He learned about Cheliax as the pinnacle of civilization. He learned about his own people as monsters barely distinguishable from animals.</p>
<p>He read these lies with perfect comprehension and growing internal fury.</p>
<p><strong>Theology</strong> was the worst. Hours of Asmodean doctrine explaining why hierarchy was divine, why suffering was instructive, why his natural place was at the bottom of all creation.</p>
<p>He memorized every word. Recited every prayer. Passed every test.</p>
<p>And inside, something in him hardened into quiet, unshakeable refusal. They could make him read their words. They couldn't make him believe them.</p>
<h2 id="the-curse">The Curse</h2>
<p>Education was supposed to be a gift. In the monastery's logic, teaching the goblin child to read was an act of extraordinary charity. Proof of their mercy and patience.</p>
<p>But <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a> learned quickly that every gift came with a price.</p>
<p><strong>The price was visibility.</strong></p>
<p>Before the test, he'd been furniture. A small goblin hauling chamber pots and scrubbing floors. Beneath notice as long as he completed his work silently.</p>
<p>After the test, he was an anomaly. A goblin who could read. A creature who demonstrated intelligence that shouldn't exist according to their theology.</p>
<p>Some of the Sisters found this fascinating. Others found it threatening. All of them watched him more closely.</p>
<p><strong>The price was expectation.</strong></p>
<p>The human children were allowed to be mediocre. They could make mistakes, have bad days, forget their lessons. They were children being educated, and children make errors.</p>
<p>Rust had no such allowance. Every mistake was evidence of his fundamental inferiority. Every success was surprising, noteworthy, annotated in ledgers as an exception that proved the rule.</p>
<p>He learned to be perfect. Not good—perfect. To prepare more thoroughly than anyone else. To never forget a single lesson. To make no errors because errors meant punishment meant proof that teaching the goblin had been a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>The price was isolation.</strong></p>
<p>The human children had barely tolerated him before. Now they resented him. He was younger than most of them, a goblin, and he read better than children three years his senior.</p>
<p>They called him names. "Teacher's pet." "Show-off." "Trying to be human." They made his life harder when the Sisters weren't watching—hiding his study materials, giving him wrong information, making him late to lessons so he'd be punished for tardiness.</p>
<p>He endured it in silence. What else could he do?</p>
<p><strong>The price was becoming useful.</strong></p>
<p>The monastery began assigning him new tasks:
- Copying texts in his precise handwriting
- Organizing library materials
- Translating simple Goblin documents ("know the enemy")
- Recording minutes during administrative meetings</p>
<p>This work was less physically taxing than hauling chamber pots. But it meant spending more time around the Sisters. More visibility. More chances to make mistakes that would be remembered.</p>
<p>It meant being useful—and useful things are kept close, controlled carefully, watched constantly.</p>
<p><strong>The price was understanding.</strong></p>
<p>Ignorance had been protection. When he couldn't read, the monastery's texts about goblin inferiority were just sounds, symbols, things the Sisters believed but that didn't touch him directly.</p>
<p>Now he could read their documentation. Their theological justifications for abuse. Their detailed records of how many goblin children they'd "processed" over the years. Their proud accounts of "civilizing" lesser races through systematic degradation.</p>
<p>He understood, with perfect literacy, exactly what they thought of him. Exactly what they were doing to him and why. Exactly how they justified every cruelty as necessary education.</p>
<p>Knowledge wasn't power. Knowledge was a different kind of prison—one where you could see every bar clearly and understand exactly why you'd never be allowed to leave.</p>
<h2 id="the-trap-of-exceptionalism">The Trap of Exceptionalism</h2>
<p>At five years old, <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a> was learning a lesson that would take years to fully understand:</p>
<p>Being exceptional was a trap.</p>
<p>If he'd been ordinary—a goblin who couldn't read, who demonstrated nothing but brute capacity for menial labor—he might have simply faded into the background. Invisible, beneath notice, able to exist in the cracks of the monastery's attention.</p>
<p>But he'd shown intelligence. He'd demonstrated capacity beyond what their theology said he should possess. He'd become interesting.</p>
<p>And interesting things get studied.</p>
<p><a href="/Kingmaker/NPCs/Sister Velenne.html">Sister Velenne</a> hadn't yet taken special interest in him. That would come a year later. But the foundations were being laid. Sister Malhana's notes about his unusual capacity were in the records. Other Sisters were observing him with curiosity and calculation.</p>
<p>He'd proven he was more than a simple laborer. More than a charity case. More than a minor investment in civilization's mercy toward savage races.</p>
<p>He'd proven he was smart enough to be worth breaking properly.</p>
<h2 id="the-books">The Books</h2>
<p>Despite everything—despite the isolation, the expectation, the constant surveillance—<a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a> loved books.</p>
<p>In the monastery's small library, among theological texts and administrative records, he found something the Sisters hadn't anticipated: he found windows to other worlds.</p>
<p>Books about lands beyond Cheliax. Stories about heroes who fought tyrants (annotated by the Sisters as "cautionary tales about the sin of rebellion"). Histories written before Asmodean dominance, when other perspectives existed.</p>
<p>The Sisters meant for him to read only approved texts. But they underestimated both his reading speed and his developing cleverness. During copying work, he read passages from books he was organizing. During cleaning, he memorized titles and returned after hours when he was supposed to be sleeping.</p>
<p>The library became his sanctuary. The only place where he could exist in someone else's thoughts, someone else's perspective, someone else's world where small goblin children weren't inherently worthless.</p>
<p>He read about places where different races worked together. About goblins portrayed as complex beings rather than savage caricatures. About heroes who questioned authority and were proved right.</p>
<p>The Sisters would have beaten him senseless if they knew. These weren't the lessons they intended him to learn.</p>
<p>But books don't care about intention. Books teach what they teach. And Rust was learning:</p>
<p>The monastery's version of truth wasn't the only truth. Their theology wasn't universal law. Their treatment of him wasn't inevitable or natural—it was chosen, constructed, deliberate.</p>
<p>He was five years old, reading by candlelight in a cold library, learning that the people who abused him were wrong.</p>
<p>He couldn't act on this knowledge. He was too young, too small, too powerless. But he could hold it inside himself like a coal, burning quietly, waiting.</p>
<h2 id="the-moment-of-recognition">The Moment of Recognition</h2>
<p>Three months after the literacy test, <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a> was in the library, copying a theological text. It was late afternoon. He was alone, working in the dim light from high windows.</p>
<p>He finished the assigned passage and looked at the next page—not part of his assignment, but visible.</p>
<p>The text discussed the nature of inferior races and their natural place in divine hierarchy. It claimed that goblins lacked the capacity for complex thought, for moral reasoning, for genuine learning. They could be trained, like animals, but never truly educated.</p>
<p>Rust looked down at his own handwriting. Perfect copperplate script, each letter precise and beautiful. He looked at the mathematics he'd done that morning—complex calculations completed faster than the human children twice his age. He thought about the books he'd read, the concepts he'd mastered, the questions he could ask but didn't because asking meant punishment.</p>
<p>And he thought: <em>They're wrong.</em></p>
<p>Simple. Direct. Undeniable.</p>
<p>They were wrong about goblins. Wrong about him. Wrong in their theology, their hierarchy, their entire understanding of how the world worked.</p>
<p>He was five years old. He couldn't challenge them. Couldn't argue. Couldn't even speak this truth aloud without inviting destruction.</p>
<p>But he could know it. Hold it inside himself like a secret weapon, waiting for the day when it might matter.</p>
<p>The monastery had given him literacy intending to make him a better servant. Instead, they'd given him the tools to see through their lies.</p>
<p>It was both gift and curse.</p>
<p>Gift: understanding, knowledge, the ability to see the bars of his cage clearly.</p>
<p>Curse: understanding, knowledge, the inability to unsee what he'd learned.</p>
<h2 id="the-cost-of-knowing">The Cost of Knowing</h2>
<p>That night, <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a> lay in his cold bed near the door and thought about the test.</p>
<p>If he'd failed—if he'd looked at that page and seen only meaningless shapes—what would his life be?</p>
<p>He'd still be hauling chamber pots, scrubbing floors, doing work that exhausted him. Still hungry, cold, isolated. Still at the bottom of the monastery's hierarchy.</p>
<p>But he wouldn't know why. Wouldn't understand the systematic nature of his oppression. Wouldn't be able to read their documentation of his worthlessness in their own hand.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he thought, ignorance might be easier.</p>
<p>But he couldn't choose ignorance. The knowledge was in him now, permanent as his name, deeper than his hunger.</p>
<p>He knew he was intelligent. Knew the monastery's theology was propaganda. Knew his suffering wasn't divine instruction—it was cruelty dressed in religious language.</p>
<p>And knowing this, unable to act on it, unable to speak it, unable to change anything about his circumstances—that was its own kind of torture.</p>
<p>The literacy test had changed everything and nothing.</p>
<p>Everything: how the Sisters saw him, how the other children treated him, what work he did, what he understood about his own oppression.</p>
<p>Nothing: his place in the hierarchy, his powerlessness, his daily suffering, his fundamental lack of freedom.</p>
<p>He was smarter now. More aware. Better educated.</p>
<p>He was still a prisoner. Still a goblin. Still at the mercy of people who believed hurting him was righteous.</p>
<p>Intelligence hadn't freed him. It had just made the cage visible.</p>
<h2 id="the-year-after">The Year After</h2>
<p>The months following the test established a new pattern for <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a>'s life.</p>
<p><strong>Mornings:</strong> Still brutal physical labor, but less of it. His afternoons were reserved for lessons now, so the morning work shifted to other children. He still got the worst tasks, still worked harder than the human children, but it was no longer dawn-to-dusk exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong>Afternoons:</strong> Study. Reading, writing, arithmetic, theology, history. He excelled at everything, which brought its own problems. Teacher Sisters who alternated between pride in their successful "civilizing" work and resentment that a goblin could learn so well.</p>
<p><strong>Evenings:</strong> Copying work, organizing, translating. Useful tasks that kept him visible, supervised, controlled.</p>
<p><strong>Nights:</strong> Stolen time in the library when he could manage it. Reading things he shouldn't. Learning truths the monastery never intended to teach.</p>
<p>He turned six years old that year, though no one celebrated. The monastery didn't mark goblin birthdays.</p>
<p>By six, his handwriting was neater than most adults'. His reading comprehension exceeded children twice his age. His mathematical abilities were sharp enough that Sisters consulted his calculations.</p>
<p>He'd become useful. Valuable, in a limited sense.</p>
<p>This would save him exactly nothing when <a href="/Kingmaker/NPCs/Sister Velenne.html">Sister Velenne</a> began her systematic testing a few months later.</p>
<p>Being intelligent didn't protect him from abuse. It just made him a more interesting subject for experimentation.</p>
<p>The literacy test had given him knowledge, understanding, the ability to see his cage clearly.</p>
<p>It had not given him the key.</p>
<h2 id="reflection-at-thirteen">Reflection at Thirteen</h2>
<p>At thirteen, eight years after that pivotal test, <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a> can see the moment clearly for what it was: the day his childhood ended and his education in futility began.</p>
<p>The monastery gave him literacy thinking it would make him a better servant. They were partially right—he became useful, valuable for his skills.</p>
<p>What they didn't anticipate was that literacy would also make him see. Would give him the tools to understand his oppression, to question their theology, to recognize that his suffering wasn't divine instruction but systematic cruelty.</p>
<p>They taught him to read so he could copy their texts. Instead, he used reading to find cracks in their worldview, contradictions in their claims, evidence that they were wrong.</p>
<p>They taught him to write so he could record their lessons. Instead, he used writing to clarify his own thoughts, to work through the contradictions between what they claimed and what he experienced.</p>
<p>They taught him to think so he could understand complex theological arguments. Instead, he used thinking to dismantle those arguments, to see through their logic, to hold onto his own understanding despite years of indoctrination.</p>
<p>The literacy test was supposed to be a gift. Proof of the monastery's mercy and patience in educating even a goblin.</p>
<p>Instead, it became his first weapon against them. Not a physical weapon—he was five years old and utterly powerless.</p>
<p>But a weapon nonetheless. The ability to know they were wrong. To hold that knowledge inside himself where they couldn't reach it. To preserve some core of resistance they could never quite break.</p>
<p>That test divided his life into before and after.</p>
<p>Before: a child who suffered without understanding why.</p>
<p>After: a child who suffered with perfect clarity about the systematic, deliberate, ideological nature of his abuse.</p>
<p>He's not sure which was worse.</p>
<p>But he's certain of this: the moment he learned to read, the moment he demonstrated intelligence the monastery's theology said he shouldn't possess, the moment he proved he was more than they believed—</p>
<p>That was the moment he became both more valuable and more dangerous to them.</p>
<p>That was the moment <a href="/Kingmaker/NPCs/Sister Velenne.html">Sister Velenne</a> began to notice him.</p>
<p>That was the moment his real education in suffering began.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>"The day I learned to read was the day I learned to understand exactly what they thought of me. They put their ideology in writing—every justification for hurting me, every claim about my fundamental worthlessness. And they taught me to read it fluently. I don't think they realized what they were doing. They gave me the tools to see through every lie they told. They thought literacy would make me a better servant. Instead, it taught me how to quietly, secretly, refuse to believe anything they said."</em> - Rust, age 13</p>
