<p><em>Content Warning: This narrative deals with the aftermath of severe trauma, survival in the wilderness as a child, the difficulty of adjusting to freedom after prolonged captivity, and the discovery that escape doesn't immediately equal healing.</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-first-night-alone">The First Night Alone</h2>
<p><a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a> spent his first night of freedom in a hollow tree, three miles from where he'd left <a href="/Kingmaker/NPCs/Mika.html">Mika</a>, fifteen miles from the <a href="/Kingmaker/Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes.html">monastery</a>.</p>
<p>He didn't sleep. Not because he wasn't exhausted—he was bone-tired, drained from <a href="/Kingmaker/Events/Rust's Awakening.html">the awakening</a> and the escape. But because every sound in the darkness made him tense for pursuit. Every crack of a branch was a Sister's footstep. Every rustle of leaves was armed monks coming to drag him back.</p>
<p>The monastery had taught him hypervigilance. Freedom didn't unteach it.</p>
<p>He sat with his back against the tree's interior wall, knees drawn up, listening to the night. His new power hummed under his skin—unfamiliar, uncomfortable, too large for his small frame. He could feel the life around him in ways he'd never experienced before: the slow pulse of trees, the quick heartbeats of nocturnal animals, the interconnected web of living things that made up the forest.</p>
<p>It was overwhelming. Beautiful. Terrifying.</p>
<p><em>I'm free,</em> he thought, testing the concept. <em>No more Sisters. No more experiments. No more punishment cells or mandatory prayers or hunger used as discipline. I'm free.</em></p>
<p>He waited to feel joy. Relief. Something positive.</p>
<p>Instead, he felt: Terror. Confusion. Guilt about Mika. Uncertainty about what freedom even meant when you'd never experienced it before.</p>
<p>And underneath everything else: the strange weight of the presence he'd accepted into himself. The vast, primordial thing that sustained his power. It didn't speak to him—not in words—but he felt it. Always. A pressure at the back of his mind. A reminder that he wasn't entirely alone, but also not entirely himself anymore.</p>
<p><em>What have I become?</em> he wondered, not for the first or last time.</p>
<p>The forest had no answer. So Rust stayed awake, keeping watch against threats both real and imagined, until dawn broke and his first full day of freedom began.</p>
<h2 id="survival-without-walls">Survival Without Walls</h2>
<p>The monastery had been horrible, but it had provided structure. Regular meals, even if inadequate. Shelter from weather. Predictable routines. Basic necessities.</p>
<p>Freedom meant figuring out everything for himself.</p>
<p><strong>Food:</strong> Rust discovered quickly that knowing which plants were edible didn't make them easy to find or pleasant to eat. The <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust Timeline/06 - Survival Strategies.html">garden knowledge</a> he'd accumulated helped—he could identify safe berries, edible roots, medicinal herbs. But he was twelve years old, small even for a goblin, and constant foraging barely kept him from hunger.</p>
<p>He tried hunting. Failed miserably. His monastery education hadn't included trapping or tracking game. He could read three languages and calculate compound interest, but he couldn't catch a rabbit to save his life.</p>
<p>Literally. His life might depend on it.</p>
<p><strong>Shelter:</strong> The first week, he slept in whatever natural cover he could find—hollow trees, rocky overhangs, dense thickets. None of it felt safe. All of it felt exposed. The monastery had been a prison, but it had been a prison with solid walls and a roof.</p>
<p>By the second week, he'd learned to build basic shelters from branches and leaves. They didn't keep out rain well, and they provided no warmth, but they were better than nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Water:</strong> Easy enough to find streams and springs. Harder to know which were safe to drink from. He got sick twice in the first month from contaminated water. His healing power kept him from dying, but it didn't make dysentery pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> Rust moved south and west, away from the monastery, following game trails and avoiding roads. He had no destination in mind—just "away." As far from the Sisters as possible. Deep into wilderness where humans rarely traveled.</p>
<p>He was running. Not toward anything. Just away.</p>
<h2 id="the-discovery-animals-understand">The Discovery: Animals Understand</h2>
<p>Three weeks into freedom, Rust discovered something unexpected about his new power.</p>
<p>He'd been trying to trap a rabbit for days—setting snares according to instructions he half-remembered from a survival book in the monastery library. They never worked. The rabbits avoided his traps with what seemed like deliberate intelligence.</p>
<p>On the third week, hungry and frustrated, Rust sat down near his latest failed snare and just... gave up. Not permanently. Just for that moment. He was too tired to keep trying.</p>
<p>A rabbit emerged from the underbrush. The same rabbit, he thought, that he'd been trying to catch. It should have run. Instead, it sat a few feet away and watched him.</p>
<p>Rust watched back. And in the watching, he felt something: the rabbit's fear, yes, but also curiosity. Awareness. An intelligence that wasn't human but was still <em>there</em>.</p>
<p>"I'm hungry," Rust said aloud, not expecting response. "I don't know how to catch you. I'm not very good at this."</p>
<p>The rabbit twitched its nose. Didn't run.</p>
<p>Rust extended his hand slowly, palm up. Empty. Offering nothing. Just... reaching out.</p>
<p>The rabbit hopped closer. Sniffed his fingers. And Rust felt—connection. Not words. Not thoughts exactly. But communication of a sort. Understanding flowing both directions.</p>
<p>The rabbit understood he was hungry. Understood he meant it harm (for food, not cruelty). And it made a choice: it stayed anyway. Not because it wanted to die, but because something about Rust—the presence inside him, the primordial power—registered as safe. As something that belonged to the natural world in ways the monastery never had.</p>
<p>The rabbit didn't let him catch it that day. But the next day, it returned. And the day after. Eventually, it led him to better foraging spots. Warned him away from dangers he couldn't see. Became something like a companion, though neither of them would have used that word.</p>
<p>Other animals followed. Birds that perched nearby and sang warnings of approaching humans. A fox that showed him a good den location. A doe that let him approach close enough to touch her, absorbing his loneliness for a moment in exchange for nothing.</p>
<p>Animals trusted him. They sensed something in him—the primordial presence, the connection to life and healing—that made him feel safe despite his small predator's body.</p>
<p>It was the first time since <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust Timeline/07 - Mika Arrives.html">Mika</a> that Rust felt less alone.</p>
<h2 id="nightmares-and-daylight">Nightmares and Daylight</h2>
<p>Physical survival was challenging. Psychological survival was harder.</p>
<p>Rust had nightmares every night. Sometimes he dreamed he was still in the monastery—the escape had been illusion, and he'd wake to find <a href="/Kingmaker/NPCs/Sister Velenne.html">Velenne</a> standing over him. Sometimes he dreamed of the awakening—the breaking, the presence, the moment he'd stopped being entirely himself. Sometimes he dreamed of Mika, and those were worst of all.</p>
<p>During the day, he experienced flashbacks. A sudden sound would put him back in Velenne's study. A particular quality of light through trees would recall the monastery chapel. The smell of certain plants triggered memories of punishment details in the garden.</p>
<p>He learned to manage them, mostly. Grounding techniques he'd taught himself during years of torture: count five things he could see, four he could touch, three he could hear. Remind himself where he was. When he was. That the monastery was behind him.</p>
<p>But management wasn't healing. And freedom wasn't safety. Not really. Because the threats he'd escaped weren't just external—they'd taken up residence in his mind.</p>
<p><strong>Hypervigilance:</strong> He couldn't turn it off. Every person he saw from a distance (he avoided them all) was a potential Sister or monastery ally. Every sound at night was pursuit. He slept in brief increments, never more than an hour at a time, always ready to run.</p>
<p><strong>Dissociation:</strong> Sometimes, when stress got too high, part of him just... left. He'd come back to awareness miles from where he'd started, time missing, no memory of the journey. His body kept functioning, kept surviving, while his mind retreated to somewhere safe.</p>
<p><strong>The Power:</strong> His oracle abilities were unpredictable. Sometimes they worked when he didn't want them to—healing minor injuries on animals who came near him, absorbing their pain whether he intended to or not. Sometimes they didn't work when he needed them—his own minor injuries (cuts from thorns, bruises from falls) healing slowly, normally, as if the power had decided to rest.</p>
<p>He didn't understand the rules. Didn't know how to control it. The presence inside him offered no instruction manual.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-human-encounter">The First Human Encounter</h2>
<p>Six weeks after escape, Rust encountered his first human since leaving the monastery.</p>
<p>He'd been following a stream, looking for fish (he still couldn't catch them, but hope springs eternal). Around a bend, he saw a woman filling water jugs—a farmer, from her practical clothes and sun-weathered skin.</p>
<p>Rust froze. She looked up. Their eyes met.</p>
<p>For a moment, neither moved. Then the woman's expression shifted—surprise to fear to something Rust couldn't quite name. Disgust? Hatred?</p>
<p>"Get away from here, goblin," she said, her voice hard. "We don't want your kind around. You're not welcome."</p>
<p>Rust had expected this. He'd known intellectually that the world outside the monastery wouldn't be welcoming. But knowing and experiencing were different.</p>
<p>"I'm just passing through," he said, keeping his voice calm, non-threatening. "I don't want trouble."</p>
<p>"Too bad. Your kind is trouble. Now go, before I call my husband and his friends."</p>
<p>Rust went. What else could he do? He was twelve, weaponless, alone. Fighting was pointless. Explaining was impossible.</p>
<p>But as he retreated into the forest, he heard the woman muttering: "Goblin trash. Should hunt them all down like the old days. World was better when we didn't tolerate monsters."</p>
<p>Monsters.</p>
<p>The monastery had taught him he was worthless. This woman taught him he was worse than worthless. Actively dangerous. Something to be eliminated.</p>
<p><em>The Sisters broke me for ten years,</em> Rust thought as he put distance between himself and the stream. <em>But at least they fed me. At least they acknowledged I existed.</em></p>
<p><em>Out here, I'm just vermin. Something to be exterminated on sight.</em></p>
<p>He'd escaped one kind of hell. He was discovering that freedom came with its own horrors.</p>
<h2 id="finding-work-sort-of">Finding Work (Sort Of)</h2>
<p>Rust couldn't survive indefinitely on foraged food and animal companionship. He needed money. Or at least barter goods. Which meant he needed work.</p>
<p>But who would hire a twelve-year-old goblin?</p>
<p>His animal affinity provided the answer. Two months after escape, desperately hungry, Rust approached a farm from downwind at dusk. Not to steal—he'd learned that lesson in the monastery: theft invited worse punishment than the benefit was worth. But maybe to offer labor in exchange for food.</p>
<p>The farmer saw him. Reached for a weapon. Rust raised his hands, showing he was unarmed, non-threatening.</p>
<p>"I can work," he said quickly. "I know animals. I can help with livestock. Just for food. I won't steal. I won't cause trouble. Just... I'm hungry."</p>
<p>The farmer studied him. His wife appeared in the doorway, scowling. They argued in low voices. Finally, the farmer turned back.</p>
<p>"One night. You work sunrise to sunset tomorrow. You sleep in the barn, not the house. If anything goes missing, if you cause any problems, I'll have the authorities on you so fast—"</p>
<p>"I understand. Thank you."</p>
<p>And so Rust got his first job. The farmer's animals—sheep, mostly—responded to Rust immediately. Calmed by his presence. The farmer noticed this, grudgingly impressed.</p>
<p>"You've got a way with them," he admitted. "Strange."</p>
<p>"Gift," Rust said, not elaborating.</p>
<p>He worked that day. Got a meal and a night in shelter. The next morning, the farmer offered him another day's work. Then another.</p>
<p>It lasted a week. Then the farmer's neighbor came by, saw Rust, and made such a fuss about "harboring goblin trash" that the farmer apologetically but firmly told Rust to leave.</p>
<p>"You're a good worker," the farmer said. "But I can't afford the trouble. My neighbors... they remember the wars. They won't tolerate your kind around."</p>
<p>Rust moved on. Found other odd jobs when he could—always temporary, always ending when someone objected to his presence, always paying barely enough to keep him fed.</p>
<p>It was survival. Not life. But it was better than the monastery.</p>
<p>At least, he told himself it was.</p>
<h2 id="three-months-free-taking-stock">Three Months Free: Taking Stock</h2>
<p>By the end of his third month of freedom, Rust had established a precarious existence:</p>
<p><strong>Physical Survival:</strong> Barely adequate food. Temporary shelter. Enough work to get by. His body was healing from ten years of malnutrition—slowly, but noticeably. He'd grown an inch. Put on a few pounds. Still small for his age, but less skeletal.</p>
<p><strong>Psychological State:</strong> Traumatized but functional. Nightmares constant. Flashbacks manageable. Hypervigilance exhausting but protective. He'd learned to function with broken pieces, even if he couldn't fully fix them.</p>
<p><strong>Power Understanding:</strong> Still minimal. The oracle abilities worked unpredictably. He could heal small injuries on animals who trusted him. He could sense pain and suffering in living things nearby. But control was elusive. Understanding was incomplete.</p>
<p><strong>Social Status:</strong> Pariah. He'd learned that goblins were tolerated at best, actively hated at worst. The <a href="/Kingmaker/Events/Goblinblood Wars.html">Goblinblood Wars</a> had ended, but prejudice remained. He was alone, and would likely remain alone, because connecting with anyone meant risking rejection or worse.</p>
<p><strong>Guilt:</strong> Constant. Every day, he thought of Mika. Wondered if she'd made it to the village. If she was safe. If she hated him for abandoning her. The guilt was a weight he carried alongside the primordial presence, almost as heavy.</p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> None. He was drifting. Surviving day to day. Moving south and west because that was away from the monastery, not because anywhere else was better.</p>
<p>He needed purpose. Destination. Something beyond mere survival.</p>
<p>But he was twelve years old, traumatized, alone, carrying power he didn't understand and guilt he couldn't resolve.</p>
<p>Purpose would have to wait. For now, survival was enough.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="reflection-age-13">Reflection: Age 13</h2>
<p><em>Those first months taught me that escape isn't the same as freedom. You can break free from physical walls and still carry prison inside you.</em></p>
<p><em>I thought leaving the monastery would fix things. That once I was out, I'd be okay. That was naive. Trauma doesn't respect geography. The nightmares followed me. The hypervigilance followed me. The dissociation, the guilt, the broken pieces—all of it came along for the journey.</em></p>
<p><em>But I also learned things the monastery never taught me. That animals could be trusted in ways people couldn't. That I could survive alone if necessary. That my power, however strange and uncontrolled, connected me to the living world in ways that made isolation slightly less complete.</em></p>
<p><em>And I learned something important about freedom: it's not given, it's built. Day by day. Choice by choice. Survival by survival.</em></p>
<p><em>The monastery broke me. Escaping didn't unbreak me. But those first months started something—not healing exactly, but adaptation. Learning to exist as this new, strange, partially-other thing I'd become.</em></p>
<p><em>I was twelve years old, alone in a world that didn't want me, carrying power I couldn't control and guilt I couldn't resolve. I survived anyway.</em></p>
<p><em>Not because I was strong. Not because I had a plan. But because I'd spent ten years learning that survival, even when it's hard, even when it's lonely, even when it's just endurance without purpose—survival is still worth the effort.</em></p>
<p><em>At least, that's what I told myself. Most days, I believed it.</em></p>
