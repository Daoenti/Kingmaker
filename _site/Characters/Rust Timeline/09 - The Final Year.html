            <h1 id="the-year-everything-ended-age-12">The Year Everything Ended: Age 12</h1>
<p><em>Content Warning: This narrative deals with a child approaching complete psychological collapse, the final stages of systematic abuse, and the moments before a traumatic transformation. It depicts the absolute nadir before the awakening.</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-hollow-year">The Hollow Year</h2>
<p><a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a> turned twelve in the spring. There was no celebration, no acknowledgment. The <a href="/Kingmaker/Locations/Monastery of the Golden Erinyes.html">monastery</a> didn't mark birthdays for orphans—such recognition implied that their individual existence mattered, which contradicted the institution's entire philosophy.</p>
<p>But Rust knew. He'd been counting years since he was old enough to understand what counting meant. Twelve years old. Ten years imprisoned. A decade of his life spent in this place, shaped by these people, molded by systematic cruelty into something he barely recognized when he looked inward.</p>
<p>He'd survived <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust Timeline/08 - Escalation.html">age eleven</a>'s escalating torture. He'd made it through <a href="/Kingmaker/NPCs/Sister Velenne.html">Sister Velenne</a>'s attempts to break him completely. He was still alive, still functional, still going through the motions of daily survival.</p>
<p>But something fundamental had changed. He'd become hollow—going through routines mechanically, speaking when required, moving where directed, but with an emptiness inside that even <a href="/Kingmaker/NPCs/Mika.html">Mika</a> couldn't quite reach anymore.</p>
<p>"You're disappearing," Mika told him one night, her voice frightened. "Not physically. But you're going somewhere I can't follow."</p>
<p>She was right. Rust was retreating deeper into himself, building walls between his consciousness and the world, creating distance from everything—including pain, including hope, including her. It was a survival mechanism, but it was also a kind of death. The death of whoever he might have been if the monastery hadn't destroyed that person piece by piece.</p>
<p>At twelve years old, Rust was learning what it meant to survive past the point where survival had meaning.</p>
<h2 id="the-routine-of-emptiness">The Routine of Emptiness</h2>
<p>His twelfth year followed patterns so established they'd become automatic:</p>
<p><strong>5 AM:</strong> Wake. The bell no longer startled him—his body anticipated it, waking moments before the sound. Dress in the dark. Seven minutes to chapel.</p>
<p><strong>5:07 AM:</strong> Morning prayers in Infernal. The words flowed without thought, meaningless sounds in the language of devils. He could recite them while thinking about something else entirely, or thinking about nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>6 AM:</strong> Breakfast. Thin gruel, stale bread. Eat mechanically. Don't taste it. Don't think about being hungry. Just consume fuel and move on.</p>
<p><strong>6:30 AM:</strong> Work detail. Garden work if he was lucky, cleaning if he wasn't, punishment cells if he'd attracted attention. Hands moving, mind somewhere else. Counting stones. Mapping routes. Anything but present.</p>
<p><strong>12 PM:</strong> Midday prayers. More Infernal. More meaningless recitation. The Sisters' voices blended together into white noise.</p>
<p><strong>12:30 PM:</strong> Lunch. Same as breakfast. Food was just fuel. Nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>1 PM:</strong> Education or experimentation, depending on Velenne's schedule. The distinction between the two had collapsed—all learning involved pain now, all pain was framed as education. Read this text while standing on one leg for hours. Solve this mathematical proof while injured. Translate Goblin documents while Sister Velenne documented his physiological responses to stress.</p>
<p><strong>6 PM:</strong> Evening prayers. Infernal again. Always Infernal. The language of order, hierarchy, damnation. It was becoming his primary language, crowding out Common, burying Goblin deeper.</p>
<p><strong>6:30 PM:</strong> Dinner. Eat. Don't think. Move on.</p>
<p><strong>7 PM:</strong> Free time, supposedly. But Rust spent it alone now, avoiding even Mika. He'd go to the garden if weather permitted, sit among plants, and simply... exist. Not thinking, not planning, not hoping. Just breathing. Waiting for the next bell, the next routine, the next day identical to this one.</p>
<p><strong>9 PM:</strong> Sleep. Nightmares were guaranteed, so he'd learned to sleep lightly, never quite resting, never quite escaping. Morning would come and the cycle would begin again.</p>
<p>Day after day after day after day.</p>
<p>This was the routine of emptiness. Survival without purpose. Existence without meaning. Going through motions because stopping would invite attention, and attention meant Velenne, and Velenne meant pain he no longer had the resilience to endure.</p>
<h2 id="sister-velennes-final-phase">Sister Velenne's Final Phase</h2>
<p>Velenne had noticed his deterioration. Of course she had—she noticed everything.</p>
<p>"You're dissociating more frequently," she observed during one of their sessions. "Retreating into catatonia during stress. The mind's final defense mechanism before complete collapse."</p>
<p>She said this clinically, documenting it in her journal as she had documented everything else about him for years. But Rust detected something new in her tone: urgency mixed with frustration.</p>
<p>She was running out of time again. He was twelve now—approaching the age where he'd be transferred to the adult workforce, assigned to some Asmodean institution as laborer or servant. She'd lose access to him as a research subject. Whatever she hoped to discover, she needed to discover it soon.</p>
<p>Her experiments changed focus. Less about physical healing now, more about the source of his abilities:</p>
<p>"Tell me about the moment you first healed," she demanded. "Age two, when you arrived. You were injured. You healed impossibly fast. What do you remember?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. I was two."</p>
<p>"Useless." She made notes. "The power's source remains unidentified. No divine signature. No arcane resonance. Something else. Something primordial perhaps."</p>
<p>She was closer to truth than she knew, though Rust wouldn't understand this himself for months yet.</p>
<p>She tried new approaches: meditation techniques meant to access whatever power sustained him, alchemical compounds meant to suppress or enhance his healing, extreme stress meant to force the power to manifest more obviously.</p>
<p>Nothing worked. His healing remained constant, mysterious, inexplicable. And Velenne grew more desperate, more frustrated, more willing to push him past breaking points in pursuit of answers.</p>
<p>"You're hiding something," she accused during one particularly brutal session. "Consciously or unconsciously, you're withholding information about the source of your abilities."</p>
<p>"I don't know anything," Rust said, voice flat and empty. "I've never known anything. You've had twelve years to figure it out. Maybe there's nothing to figure out. Maybe I just heal fast and that's all there is."</p>
<p>She hit him for the insolence. He barely felt it. Pain had become background noise—always present, no longer meaningful.</p>
<p>"There's always an explanation," Velenne insisted. "Divine, arcane, primordial, something. Power doesn't manifest from nothing. Someone or something sustains you. I will discover what."</p>
<p>But she wouldn't. Not through her methods. Not through torture and documentation and clinical observation.</p>
<p>The truth would reveal itself in its own time, in its own way. And when it did, it would destroy everything she'd built.</p>
<h2 id="the-last-conversation-with-mika">The Last Conversation with Mika</h2>
<p>Three weeks before the awakening, Rust and <a href="/Kingmaker/NPCs/Mika.html">Mika</a> had their last real conversation.</p>
<p>It was late evening, past curfew, both of them lying awake in their cots. The other children were sleeping. The Sisters weren't patrolling just then. A rare moment of privacy in a place designed to eliminate privacy.</p>
<p>"Rust?" Mika's voice was small in the darkness. "Are you still in there?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer immediately. Was he? He wasn't sure anymore. The person he'd been felt distant, unreachable. What remained felt like an echo, a shadow, something wearing his shape but hollow inside.</p>
<p>"I think so," he said finally. "Some version of me."</p>
<p>"I'm scared for you," Mika whispered. "Not of you. For you. You're fading. Like you're deciding to stop existing."</p>
<p>"Maybe that would be easier."</p>
<p>"Don't say that." Her voice was fierce despite its softness. "You can't give up. Not after everything."</p>
<p>"I'm not giving up. I'm just... running out. Of energy. Of reasons. Of whatever it takes to keep going."</p>
<p>"I'm a reason. Aren't I?"</p>
<p>The question hurt worse than any of Velenne's experiments. Because she was right—she'd been his reason for the last two years. Protecting her, helping her survive, being someone she could count on. But lately, he'd been failing at even that. Retreating too far inside himself to be useful to anyone.</p>
<p>"You deserve better than me as a reason," Rust said.</p>
<p>"I don't get to choose better. You're what I have. And you're enough. You've always been enough."</p>
<p>They were quiet for a long time. Then Mika spoke again, her voice barely audible:</p>
<p>"If you ever get a chance to escape... take it. Even if I can't come with you. Promise me you'll take it."</p>
<p>"Mika—"</p>
<p>"Promise me. Because if something happens to you, if Velenne actually breaks you or kills you, then I have nothing. At least if you escape, I have hope. Hope that you're out there, free, that someone made it. That's worth more than keeping you here with me."</p>
<p>Rust wanted to argue. Wanted to promise he'd never leave without her. Wanted to say they'd escape together or not at all.</p>
<p>But he couldn't promise that. Because he knew, deep in the parts of himself that still functioned rationally, that if opportunity came, it might not wait. It might be now or never, take it or die here.</p>
<p>"I promise," he whispered. "If I get a chance, I'll take it."</p>
<p>"Good." Mika's voice was sad but satisfied. "That's all I ask. Just survive, Rust. Whatever it takes. Survive and get out and live the life they tried to take from you."</p>
<p>He didn't know that this was goodbye. Didn't know that in three weeks, everything would change, that opportunity and catastrophe would arrive together, that he'd fulfill his promise in the most violent, terrifying way possible.</p>
<p>He just knew that Mika loved him—not romantically, but the way siblings love each other, the way people love someone who's survived hell beside them. And he loved her the same way. And that love was both the best and worst thing about being alive, because it made the world bearable and unbearable simultaneously.</p>
<p>"Get some sleep," he told her. "Tomorrow's going to be another long day."</p>
<p>It was. They all were. Until the day that wasn't—the day when everything finally, catastrophically, necessarily ended.</p>
<h2 id="the-signs">The Signs</h2>
<p>Looking back, Rust could identify warning signs in his final weeks at the monastery. Symptoms of something building, some power awakening, some fundamental change approaching:</p>
<p><strong>The Dreams:</strong> Nightmares had always been constant, but these were different. Not memories of torture, but visions of something vast. Something alien. Something watching him from a distance, moving closer, interested in this small broken child who refused to die.</p>
<p>In the dreams, he stood in an infinite void, and something massive moved in the darkness beyond sight. Not hostile. Not friendly. Just... noticing. Paying attention. Considering.</p>
<p>He'd wake gasping, skin prickling with the sense of being observed by something that shouldn't be able to see him, something that existed outside normal categories of existence.</p>
<p><strong>The Healing Acceleration:</strong> Sister Velenne noted it in her journal: "Subject's regenerative abilities increasing. Injuries that once took hours now heal in minutes. Unclear cause. Unclear implications. Requires further study."</p>
<p>She thought it was natural progression. She was wrong. It was preparation—his body, or the thing sustaining his body, getting ready for something.</p>
<p><strong>The Sensitivity:</strong> Pain remained constant, but his awareness of it changed. He could feel the exact moment cells began dividing, tissue knitting, bone fusing. His healing had always been unconscious. Now it was becoming conscious, perceptible, almost controllable.</p>
<p>He didn't mention this to Velenne. Instinctively, he understood that giving her this information would be dangerous. Some knowledge shouldn't be shared with one's tormentor.</p>
<p><strong>The Anger:</strong> He'd spent years learning not to feel anger. Anger was dangerous—it led to resistance, and resistance led to punishment worse than the original offense. Better to be empty, compliant, broken.</p>
<p>But in those final weeks, anger returned. Not hot rage, but cold fury. A deep, sustained hatred for the Sisters, for the monastery, for the entire structure of cruelty and control that had shaped his childhood.</p>
<p>The anger felt foreign, like it wasn't quite his. Like something else was bleeding through into his consciousness, something ancient and primal that knew how to hate in ways humans had forgotten.</p>
<p>He should have recognized these signs. Should have understood that he was approaching some kind of threshold, some point of no return.</p>
<p>But he was twelve years old, hollowed out by a decade of trauma, with no context for understanding what was happening to him.</p>
<p>So he ignored the signs. Kept going through routines. Endured Velenne's experiments. Counted days in increments of pain.</p>
<p>Until the day he couldn't anymore.</p>
<p>Until the day something inside him—or something watching him—decided enough was enough.</p>
<p>Until the awakening.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-day-before">The Day Before</h2>
<p>The day before it happened was unremarkable in every way except retrospect.</p>
<p>Morning prayers. Breakfast. Garden work—Rust spent four hours weeding the herb garden, hands in soil, mind somewhere else. Mika worked nearby, occasionally catching his eye and offering small smiles he tried to return.</p>
<p>Midday prayers. Lunch. Afternoon in the scriptorium, translating more Goblin documents about the <a href="/Kingmaker/Events/Goblinblood Wars.html">Goblinblood Wars</a>. Sister Velenne supervised, making notes about his focus and retention, planning her next experiment.</p>
<p>Evening prayers. Dinner. An hour in the garden before curfew, sitting among the plants, watching the sun set beyond the monastery walls.</p>
<p>He thought about escape that evening. Not seriously—he'd long since abandoned serious escape planning as futile. But idly, theoretically. <em>If I could run, which direction would I choose? North toward the mountains? South toward the trade roads? East or west into the forests?</em></p>
<p>He had no answer. All directions looked equally impossible from inside the monastery walls.</p>
<p>Night fell. Curfew bell rang. Children filed to the dormitory. Rust lay in his cot, listening to Mika's breathing across from him, feeling the familiar cold of the stone floor through the thin mattress.</p>
<p><em>Just another day,</em> he thought as sleep pulled him under. <em>Tomorrow will be the same. And the day after. And the day after. Forever, probably. Until I'm too old to be useful, and they transfer me somewhere else to be broken in new ways.</em></p>
<p>He didn't know he was wrong.</p>
<p>Didn't know that tomorrow, Sister Velenne would push him one step too far.</p>
<p>Didn't know that something ancient and inhuman had been watching him for months, waiting for the right moment.</p>
<p>Didn't know that by tomorrow night, he'd be free.</p>
<p>Or that freedom would cost him something he couldn't name, a debt to something primordial he still doesn't fully understand.</p>
<p>He just knew exhaustion, cold, darkness, and the endless cycle of days that all felt the same.</p>
<p>Until tomorrow, when everything changed.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="reflection-age-13">Reflection: Age 13</h2>
<p><em>My twelfth year was strange because it was simultaneously the worst and the beginning of the end. I was more broken than I'd ever been, but I was also closest to freedom, if I'd known it.</em></p>
<p><em>I think about that last conversation with Mika constantly. She gave me permission to survive without her. She knew, somehow, that I'd have to choose. And she made the choice easier by telling me to choose myself.</em></p>
<p><em>I've tried to honor that. To survive the way she wanted me to. To live the life the monastery tried to take. But it's complicated by guilt, by not knowing if she's alive, by wondering if I abandoned her or saved myself or both.</em></p>
<p><em>The warning signs before the awakening—I recognize them now for what they were. Something was waking up. Not just in me, but something paying attention to me. Something that had been watching, waiting for the right moment to intervene.</em></p>
<p><em>I don't know why it chose me. I don't know what it wants in return. I don't know if I made a deal or if something was just... given to me. Imposed on me.</em></p>
<p><em>But I know this: that hollow year, that emptiness, that feeling of fading into nothing—it was actually preparation. My mind clearing space for something else. My body getting ready for transformation. My soul, if I have one, making room for whatever now sustains me.</em></p>
<p><em>The monastery tried to break me completely. Instead, they pushed me to exactly the point where something else could reach me. Where power could manifest. Where escape became possible.</em></p>
<p><em>They created the conditions for their own destruction. That's the part Sister Velenne will never understand, if she's even still alive. That torture doesn't just break people—sometimes it makes them dangerous.</em></p>
<p><em>I was never more broken than in my twelfth year. But I was also, unknowingly, becoming something they couldn't control anymore.</em></p>
<p><em>Tomorrow's narrative will tell what happened when that power finally woke up. When the hollow year ended and everything burned.</em></p>
