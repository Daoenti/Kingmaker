<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The monastery shaped <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a> profoundly, but it didn't break him. At 13, he's scarred but not destroyed, traumatized but not helpless, damaged but capable of healing. His ten years there gave him pain, yes, but also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resilience beyond his years</li>
<li>Compassion despite cruelty</li>
<li>Intelligence honed by necessity</li>
<li>Strength found in endurance</li>
<li>Hope maintained against odds</li>
</ul>
<p>The campaign is his journey from survivor to hero, from broken child to whole person, from running from past to building future. The monastery is where he was forged, but not where his story ends.</p>
<p>It's where his story truly begins.</p>
