<h3 id="one-year-of-experience-just-starting">One Year of Experience, Just Starting</h3>
<p>Rust has been working with animals for <strong>one year</strong> during his wandering after escaping the monastery (age 12-13). This gives him:
- <strong>Trained proficiency</strong> in Nature (standard for level 1)
- <strong>Basic competence</strong> with common domestic animals

<h3 id="how-he-developed-this-connection">How He Developed This Connection</h3>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong>
- <strong>Age 12 (escape):</strong> Fled the monastery, scared and alone
- <strong>First few months:</strong> Discovered animals didn't judge him, felt safe around them
- <strong>Ages 12-13:</strong> Worked brief stints as stable hand, farm helper, learned by doing
- <strong>Age 13 (present):</strong> Has basic skills, natural talent, much to learn</p>
<p><strong>Key Factors:</strong>
- <strong>Shared Experience:</strong> Recognized kinship with creatures deemed "lesser"
- <strong>Non-Judgmental Acceptance:</strong> Animals responded to kindness, not species or age
- <strong>Practical Need:</strong> Skills helped him find work and survive as a young goblin alone
- <strong>Emotional Safety:</strong> Animals provided companionship without complications
- <strong>Natural Affinity:</strong> Something about him puts animals at ease (unclear if mundane or related to his curse)</p>
<h3 id="professional-experience-what-hes-actually-done-in-one-year">Professional Experience (What He's Actually Done in One Year)</h3>
<p><strong>Primary: Stable Hand (Most Experience)</strong>
- Worked in 3-4 different towns over the past year
- Basic care: feeding, grooming, mucking stalls

<p><strong>Secondary: Farm Work (Several Weeks Total)</strong>
- Helped with various livestock when needed
- Fed chickens, goats, pigs
- Basic herding with dogs
- Learned animals have individual personalities
- More exposure than expertise</p>
<p><strong>Tertiary: Wilderness Observation (Ongoing)</strong>
- Camps in wild areas regularly (no money for inns)
- Watches animal behavior for survival
- Learns which creatures are dangerous, which are safe
- Uses animals to find water, predict weather
- Learning by necessity, not formal training</p>
<p><strong>Limited: Exotic Animals (Days, Not Weeks)</strong>
- Brief encounter with traveling merchants' animals
- Fascinated but intimidated by unfamiliar creatures
- More questions than answers
- Inspired him to learn more</p>
<h3 id="current-capabilities-at-age-13-level-1">Current Capabilities at Age 13, Level 1</h3>
<p><strong>Comfortable With:</strong>
- Horses (most experience, still basic level)

<h3 id="the-connection-mostly-mundane-hints-of-more">The Connection - Mostly Mundane, Hints of More</h3>

- Patient and calm demeanor (learned from trauma survival)
- Observant and careful (survival skills)

- Even aggressive animals seem less hostile</p>
<p><strong>Unclear Origin:</strong>
- Natural goblin affinity? (goblins often work with animals)
- His Life Oracle curse creating connection to living things?
- Something primordial that animals sense?
- Or simply a traumatized child finding the only beings who don't hurt him?</p>
<p>At 13, even Rust doesn't know. It mostly feels normal with occasional odd moments that make him wonder.</p>

<h3 id="personality-traits-shaped-by-animals">Personality Traits Shaped by Animals</h3>
<p>In just one year, working with animals has taught Rust:
- <strong>Patience:</strong> They can't be rushed or forced
- <strong>Gentleness:</strong> Kindness gets better results than cruelty (opposite of monastery)
- <strong>Observation:</strong> Reading subtle cues and body language
- <strong>Trust:</strong> Animals show him relationships don't have to hurt
- <strong>Worth:</strong> He's good at something, has value</p>
<h3 id="philosophical-foundation-just-beginning">Philosophical Foundation (Just Beginning)</h3>
<p>Animals are teaching Rust:
- Relationships can be based on respect, not fear
- Trust is earned through consistency and kindness
- Communication doesn't require words
- Simple care matters
- You can choose to be gentle despite experiencing cruelty</p>
<p>At 13, these are new ideas he's just starting to internalize.</p>
<h2 id="integration-with-oracle-class-at-level-1">Integration with Oracle Class at Level 1</h2>
<h3 id="thematic-synergy">Thematic Synergy</h3>
<p>Life Oracle + Animal Whisperer creates compelling character:

- <strong>Healing focus:</strong> Practicing on animals before he's comfortable with people
- <strong>Trust issues:</strong> Animals are safer to care for than humans
- <strong>Natural vs. divine:</strong> His mundane skills contrast with supernatural curse
- <strong>Growing together:</strong> Both his oracle powers and animal skills are developing</p>
<h3 id="mechanical-synergy-at-level-1">Mechanical Synergy at Level 1</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nature skill</strong> for animal knowledge and handling</li>
<li><strong>Life spells</strong> work on animals as well as humanoids</li>
<li><strong>Medicine skill</strong> applies to creature healing</li>
<li><strong>Curse manifestations</strong> might involve animal reactions (animals sense his wrongness)</li>
<li><strong>Combined approach:</strong> Natural skills plus supernatural power</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="character-complexity">Character Complexity</h3>
<p>Creates interesting dynamics:
- Comfortable with animals, anxious with people
- Trusts his trained skills, suspicious of his oracle curse
- At ease in stables, tense in crowds
- Confident with creatures, uncertain with humanoids
- Simple relationships with animals, complicated with people</p>
<h2 id="rp-guidance-for-level-1-age-13">RP Guidance for Level 1, Age 13</h2>
<h3 id="playing-the-background-appropriately">Playing the Background Appropriately</h3>
<p><strong>Do:</strong>
- Show basic competence with common animals
- Make mistakes and learn from them
- Display natural talent that's still developing
- Use animals for comfort and emotional support
- Let animal interactions reveal his gentler side</p>
<p><strong>Don't:</strong>
- Automatically succeed with all animals
- Act like a master trainer at 13
- Make it magical without actual magic
- Overshadow more experienced characters
- Forget he's still learning</p>
<h3 id="rust-specific-behaviors-at-level-1">Rust-Specific Behaviors at Level 1</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cautious confidence:</strong> Knows basics, uncertain about advanced situations</li>
<li><strong>Practical application:</strong> Uses skills for survival, not show</li>
<li><strong>Emotional connection:</strong> Animals are where he feels safe</li>
<li><strong>Learning moments:</strong> Makes mistakes, asks questions (rare for him)</li>
<li><strong>Age-appropriate:</strong> Sometimes acts like the kid he is around animals</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="character-growth-potential">Character Growth Potential</h3>
<p>As Rust levels and ages:
- <strong>Level 5 (age 15-16):</strong> Expert in Nature, significantly more skilled

- <strong>Level 15 (age 20+):</strong> Master-level understanding, near-supernatural ability

<h2 id="timeline-corrections">Timeline Corrections</h2>

<p>Rust is at the <strong>very beginning</strong> of his journey:

<li>His competence might surprise them</li>
<li>Learning to be part of team</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="development-arcs">Development Arcs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill mastery:</strong> Trained → Expert → Master</li>
<li><strong>Confidence:</strong> Uncertain → Capable → Expert</li>
<li><strong>Trust:</strong> Isolated → Connected → Bonded</li>
<li><strong>Understanding:</strong> Confused → Searching → Knowing</li>
<li><strong>Maturity:</strong> Child survivor → Young adult → Hero</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><em>At 13, I've only been free for a year. I'm still figuring out who I am when no one's telling me. Animals help. They don't care that I'm young, or goblin, or cursed. They just care if I'm kind.</em> - Rust's current perspective</p>
