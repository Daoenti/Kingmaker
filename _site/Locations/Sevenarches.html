            <h1 id="sevenarches">Sevenarches</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Region:</strong> <a href="/Kingmaker/Locations/River Kingdoms.html">Locations/River Kingdoms</a>, border with <a href="/Kingmaker/Locations/Kyonin.html">Locations/Kyonin</a><br />
<strong>Type:</strong> Ancient forest settlement/eldritch location<br />
<strong>Danger Level:</strong> Extreme - Reality unstable<br />
<strong>Accessibility:</strong> Theoretically passable, practically inadvisable<br />
<strong>Status:</strong> Perpetually active, perpetually strange</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Sevenarches appears on maps as a simple forest settlement, a straight path through from Kyonin to the River Kingdoms proper. This is catastrophically inaccurate.</p>
<p>The forest is <strong>old</strong> in a way that defies normal understanding of age. The trees remember things that shouldn't be remembered. The land operates on rules that predate conventional reality. Time doesn't flow correctly. Space doesn't connect properly. Things that should be separate bleed together.</p>
<p>It's not corrupted or evil in the traditional sense. It's <strong>primordial</strong>—a place where the fundamental laws of reality are suggestions rather than absolutes.</p>
<h2 id="physical-characteristics">Physical Characteristics</h2>
<h3 id="the-trees">The Trees</h3>
<p>Massive beyond normal growth patterns, arranged in perfect circles around cleared spaces. They don't grow randomly; they follow patterns that hurt to perceive directly. Each tree seems to exist in multiple states simultaneously—living, dying, dead, and something else entirely.</p>
<p>The trees avoid certain areas deliberately, creating clearings that shouldn't exist naturally.</p>
<h3 id="the-stones">The Stones</h3>
<p>In the center of each clearing stands a single weathered stone, carved with symbols that shift when unobserved. The symbols don't seem to be in any known language; they're more like the <strong>concept</strong> of language, information that bypasses normal comprehension and resonates directly in the mind.</p>
<p>These stones are <strong>thresholds</strong>. The clearings are <strong>doors</strong>. Things move through them that don't quite belong to this reality.</p>
<h3 id="the-silence">The Silence</h3>
<p>Sound behaves incorrectly in Sevenarches. Sometimes it travels too far, sometimes not far enough. Sometimes you hear things that happened yesterday or will happen tomorrow. The deeper into the forest, the more sound becomes unreliable as a source of information.</p>
<h2 id="temporal-anomalies">Temporal Anomalies</h2>
<p>Time is <strong>negotiable</strong> in Sevenarches:
- Travelers may experience hours while minutes pass outside
- Or experience minutes while hours pass outside
- Paths lead to places they didn't lead before
- The forest remembers versions of itself that haven't happened yet</p>
<p><a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a> ran for what felt like hours but ended at his exact entry point, suggesting the forest can fold space or time or both.</p>
<h2 id="the-attention">The Attention</h2>
<p>Something lives in Sevenarches, or multiple somethings, or one something that exists in multiple states. It's aware and curious in a way that's distinctly <strong>not</strong> human or even mortal. It notices people who enter its domain.</p>
<p>For most people, this attention is terrifying but brief. For some—those who carry their own anomalies, their own impossibilities—the attention is prolonged and <strong>interested</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-happened-to-rust">What Happened to Rust</h2>
<h3 id="the-recognition">The Recognition</h3>
<p>When <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a> entered the forest, something there <strong>recognized</strong> him. Or more accurately, recognized what he carried—his curse, his unbreakable nature, his connection to forces that operate outside divine law.</p>
<p>His power reached back without his permission, and for a moment, he touched something vast and incomprehensible. The experience showed him:</p>
<p><strong>Temporal Layering:</strong> Multiple versions of the forest existing simultaneously<br />
<strong>Threshold Nature:</strong> The clearings as literal doorways to elsewhere/elsewhen<br />
<strong>Relationship:</strong> His curse and the forest's power are related, distant cousins in impossibility</p>
<h3 id="the-offer">The Offer</h3>
<p>The forest could teach him. Show him the true nature of what sustains him. Make him understand his curse completely and give him control over it.</p>
<p>The price: understanding would change him fundamentally. He'd no longer be the goblin who escaped the monastery—he'd be something else, something that understood too much about how reality works underneath.</p>
<h3 id="the-release">The Release</h3>
<p>The forest let him go. Not because he escaped, but because it decided he wasn't ready. It sent him back to his entry point—impossible, but the forest specializes in impossible.</p>
<p>It's still waiting. Patiently. With the patience of something that measures time in epochs rather than years.</p>
<h2 id="current-status">Current Status</h2>
<p>The forest continues existing in its multiple states. The stones still mark thresholds. Things still move through the doors between realities. The forest remembers <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a> and will recognize him if he returns.</p>
<h2 id="known-inhabitants">Known Inhabitants</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Forest Itself:</strong> Potentially conscious, definitely aware</li>
<li><strong>Threshold Guardians:</strong> Things that exist between states, wearing shapes like uncomfortable clothes</li>
<li><strong>Displaced Creatures:</strong> Beings from other times/places that wandered through doors</li>
<li><strong>The Locals:</strong> A small population of mortals who've adapted to the strangeness, though "adapted" might be generous</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="warnings-from-locals">Warnings from Locals</h2>
<p>Keseth the half-elf innkeeper at Thornwatch: <em>"People who go into those woods don't come out the same. If they come out at all."</em></p>
<p>This isn't exaggeration. The forest changes people:
- Some gain knowledge they can't articulate
- Some lose time or memories
- Some come back speaking languages that don't exist
- Some don't come back at all
- Some come back but aren't quite themselves anymore</p>
<h2 id="relationship-to-rusts-curse">Relationship to Rust's Curse</h2>
<h3 id="confirmed-connections">Confirmed Connections</h3>
<ul>
<li>Both operate outside normal divine magic</li>
<li>Both involve impossibility (unbreakable flesh/impossible space)</li>
<li>Both are <strong>primordial</strong> rather than divine or arcane</li>
<li>The forest recognized Rust's curse as kin</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unknown-elements">Unknown Elements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Whether the curse originated from places like Sevenarches</li>
<li>Whether all Life Oracles have this connection or just Rust</li>
<li>What exactly the forest wanted to teach him</li>
<li>What he'd become if he accepted the offer</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="plot-hooks">Plot Hooks</h2>
<h3 id="rust-returns">Rust Returns</h3>
<ul>
<li>Desperate need for answers overrides caution</li>
<li>Someone/something he cares about can only be saved with knowledge the forest offers</li>
<li>The forest reaches out through his dreams, pulling him back</li>
<li>His curse begins failing and the forest is the only source of answers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="party-investigation">Party Investigation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Another party member needs something only found in Sevenarches</li>
<li>Tracking something that fled into the forest</li>
<li>Research into primordial magic leads here</li>
<li>Missing persons case (they entered and didn't return)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-forest-expands">The Forest Expands</h3>
<ul>
<li>The threshold clearings begin appearing elsewhere</li>
<li>Things from Sevenarches start manifesting in normal space</li>
<li>The forest's rules begin bleeding into surrounding areas</li>
<li>Someone is deliberately opening the doors wider</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="knowledge-seeking">Knowledge Seeking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scholar needs information about pre-divine magic</li>
<li>Oracular mysteries leading to primordial sources</li>
<li>Understanding curses that predate the gods</li>
<li>Fey connections and primordial bargains</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dangers">Dangers</h2>
<h3 id="physical">Physical</h3>
<ul>
<li>Predators that exist in multiple temporal states</li>
<li>Plants that grow backward and forward simultaneously</li>
<li>Terrain that rearranges when unobserved</li>
<li>Doors that lead to places you shouldn't go</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mental">Mental</h3>
<ul>
<li>Information that damages mortal minds</li>
<li>Perception of impossible geometries</li>
<li>Temporal displacement causing confusion</li>
<li>The temptation of understanding at too high a cost</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="existential">Existential</h3>
<ul>
<li>Risk of fundamental transformation</li>
<li>Losing your identity to knowledge</li>
<li>Becoming something that can't exist in normal reality</li>
<li>Getting stuck between states/times/places</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="navigation">Navigation</h2>
<p><strong>Don't.</strong></p>
<p>If absolutely necessary:
- Don't touch the stones
- Don't try to understand the symbols
- Don't listen to voices that speak without sound
- Don't accept offers of knowledge
- Don't assume the path leads where it should
- Mark your entry point (not that it helps)
- Travel in groups (misery loves company)
- Bring someone who can navigate by instinct rather than reason</p>
<p><a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a> survived by running on pure panic and being released by the forest's decision. This is not a reliable escape strategy.</p>
<h2 id="potential-resolutions">Potential Resolutions</h2>
<h3 id="rust-accepts">Rust Accepts</h3>
<p>Learns true nature of his curse, gains control over it, but loses some essential part of his identity. Powerful but changed.</p>
<h3 id="rust-refuses-again">Rust Refuses (Again)</h3>
<p>Maintains his identity at cost of never fully understanding his power. Chooses mystery over certainty, self over knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="rust-bargains">Rust Bargains</h3>
<p>Negotiates with whatever consciousness inhabits the forest. Gains partial understanding without complete transformation. Middle path with uncertain consequences.</p>
<h3 id="destructionclosure">Destruction/Closure</h3>
<p>Finds way to seal the thresholds, limiting the forest's reach. Protects others but loses potential answers forever.</p>
<h2 id="connection-to-broader-world">Connection to Broader World</h2>
<p>Sevenarches suggests:
- Divine magic isn't the oldest magic
- Gods built their systems on something more primal
- Reality has foundational layers beneath normal perception
- Some curses/powers predate current cosmic order</p>
<p>This has implications for <a href="/Kingmaker/Characters/Rust.html">Rust</a>'s oracle powers and potentially other primordial mysteries in your campaign.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>The trees grow in circles. The stones mark doors. The forest remembers you. And when you're ready—when you understand what you are—it will teach you. Whether you want to learn or not.</em></p>
